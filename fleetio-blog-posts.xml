      <title>New Feature: Vehicle Issues</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/5/new-feature-vehicle-issues</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/53ac449ee4b0927a7ce0a46b/1403798686725/issue.jpg" /><p>How often does an employee report an issue with a vehicle that was unforeseen and not scheduled to be addressed by a service provider? </p>

<p>Unfortunately these situations arise more often than one would like. </p>

<p>At Fleetio, we want your users to be able to easily log and track repairs of this nature to ensure your fleet is operating effectively and efficiently. This is why we are happy to introduce the new Issues feature in Fleetio!</p>

<p>Through Issues, users can easily report, manage and alert others about issues for vehicles that are not categorized under the Preventative Maintenance umbrella.</p>

<p>To learn more about the new vehicle Issues feature, check out these Help Center articles:</p>

      <title>Heartbleed Vulnerability Update</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/4/heartbleed-vulnerability-update</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A major security flaw, <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">dubbed “Heartbleed”</a>, was detected this week in OpenSSL - the encryption standard used by the majority of websites and services on the internet.</p>

<p>We took immediate steps to patch the potential vulnerability in our infrastructure, and Fleetio is no longer vulnerable.</p>

<p>We have no evidence of any malicious behavior, but we strongly encourage you to <a href="https://secure.fleetio.com/users/password/new">change your Fleetio password</a>. We also recommend you change your passwords everywhere else, since this vulnerability affects many services and websites you use.</p>

      <title>Q&amp;A with Mark Voltz from Joerns about switching to sprinter vans</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/3/qa-with-mark-voltz-from-joerns-about-switching-to-sprinter-vans</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5321b9b5e4b06b0112fe4242/1394719158398/#img.jpg" /><p>One of our Fleetio customers, <a href="http://www.joerns.com/">Joerns</a>, recently made the move from trucks to sprinter vans for their fleet of around 150 vehicles. We thought it was an interesting move, so we reached out to Mark Voltz, National Logistics Support Manager at Joerns, with a few questions.</p>

<h3 id="whatdoesjoernsdoandhowisthefleetused">What does Joerns do and how is the fleet used?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.joerns.com/">Joerns</a> provides innovative medical solutions to patients throughout the country. We have over 60 locations nationwide and a network of Service Technicians which provide delivery, removal and service 24/7 for all equipment. We proudly serve our Veterans as we are one of the top service providers to VA Medical Facilities throughout the U.S.</p>

<h3 id="joernsrecentlymovedfromafleetoftruckstosprintervanswhy">Joerns recently moved from a fleet of trucks to sprinter vans. Why?</h3>

<p>I would say the biggest “deciding factor” was focused around dependability and fuel savings. The Sprinter has proven itself in the market as a reliable and well-built vehicle. </p>

<p>When you look at MPG comparisons of our previous Fleet of vans/straight trucks, we are now averaging 20-22 mpg compared to the previous 10-14 mpg. Additionally, the Sprinter has been known to optimally run in excess of 350,000 miles when looking at the life expectancy of vehicles.</p>

<h3 id="whatkindofsprintersdidyouchooseandwhy">What kind of sprinters did you choose and why?</h3>

<p>We chose the <a href="http://www.mbsprinterusa.com/sprinter/cargo-van">Mercedes Benz Sprinter 2500 Cargo</a> (high roof /170” wheelbase/diesel). We’ve equipped each Sprinter with added safety features/appliances and this vehicle is really like a rolling warehouse; with plenty of storage and the ability to stand up &amp; work inside the vehicle.</p>

<h3 id="anychallengesduringorafterthetransitiontosprinters">Any challenges during or after the transition to sprinters?</h3>

<p>As is the case anytime you change the vehicle type over such  broad scope, you must take the time to make sure your staff knows all of the features and is safely comfortable with their new vehicle.</p>

<h3 id="ifsomeoneisconsideringmakingasimilarchangeintheirfleetwhatadvicewouldyougivethem">If someone is considering making a similar change in their fleet, what advice would you give them?</h3>

<p>Look at your true needs and do the due diligence to include potential savings in comparison to the overall purchase price. Know your business needs will most likely change and we’ve found the Sprinter ready and willing to make the changes we decide to continue to enhance our service to our customers.</p>

<h2 id="aboutmarkvoltz">About Mark Voltz</h2>

<p>Mark has been with <a href="http://www.joerns.com/">Joerns</a> for 5 years (over 30 years spent in the field service/logistics sector) and is currently the National Logistics Support Manager. Safety &amp; fleet/fuel are two of my primary roles for the entire field service organization.  </p>

<p>Mark is centrally based in St. Louis, MO and often travels between Joerns' two corporate locations in Chatsworth, CA &amp; Charlotte, NC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New Referral Program</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/2/new-referral-program</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/530ba91be4b01764e003439a/1393273116269/Referrals_-_Fleetio.png" /><p>Many of our customers have been gracious enough to recommend Fleetio to their friends and contacts who also have a fleet (we ♥ you guys!). Now we have great way for you to refer others and “wet your beak” as well.</p>

<p>We’ve added a simple referral program that rewards both you and the account you refer when they upgrade.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Give out your referral code or special link with referral code included.</li>
<li>When someone visits the Fleetio website using your referral link or enters your referral code on the Subscription and Billing page, your account will be linked to the referral.</li>
<li>When the referral becomes a paying Fleetio customer, you both receive a credit on your next Fleetio bill.</li>
</ol>

<p>Read more of the details in our <a href="http://help.fleetio.com/article/72-referrals">Help Center</a>.</p>

<h2 id="spreadingtheword">Spreading the word</h2>

<p>We also made it easy to share Fleetio (along with your referral code) with your network of friends and contacts. You can quickly email someone your link, or post it to various social networks all from within Fleetio.</p>

<h2 id="thanksitmeanstheworldtous">Thanks, it means the world to us</h2>

<p>We love when customers recommend us to others. Of course it’s nice to get more customers and grow our business, but the most significant part is that someone thought enough of Fleetio to recommend it. That means the world to us.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Efficient Vehicle Management: Making the Most of Your Time</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/2/making-the-most-of-your-time</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52fcc97ee4b012d3648fc75c/1392298367683/Clocks%20Leo%20Reynolds.jpg" /><p><span><span>Fleet management is seemingly notorious for its challenging and sometimes overwhelming nature. With the vast number of responsibilities involved, it is easy to see why. The key to success is automating as much of the process as possible and making the most of the time you have available. Here are some tools, methods, as well as areas of focus that can streamline your fleet operations.</span></span></p><h2><span><span style="font-size:17px">Time Saving Tools</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Gone are the days where you are required to be at your desk for eight hours. There are plenty of online tools available today that can be accessed from any internet-connected device. So whether you are using a mobile phone, tablet or desktop, you should be able to <a href="http://fleetio.com">log fleet data and access it from pretty much anywhere</a>.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Web-Based Software</strong></span></p><p><span><span>Fuel, being your most frequent entry, needs to be an easy add. If you are adding this information to an excel spreadsheet or waiting until the end of the month to add up receipts, then you need to re-evaluate the situation. Let the data do the work for you with <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/">automatic MPG</a> as well as cost/mile calculations. Intelligent fleet software platforms make it very easy to get data in and get useful info out.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Fuel Card Integration</strong></span></p><p><span><span>The easiest way to control fuel expenses is with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_card">Fuel Cards</a> and fleet software that <a href="http://fleetio.com/fuel-cards">automatically links up with those cards</a>. Typically, a fleet card comes with limited or separate reporting, but by connecting transactions from the pump to the rest of your expenses and activity, reporting is both easy and comprehensive.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Active or Passive Tracking</strong></span></p><p><span><span>As a fleet manager, you can save a lot of time and effort by letting the vehicles talk to you. <a href="http://fleet-genius.com/system">Onboard OBD devices</a> or GPS hardware make this possible. Instead of relying on drivers to communicate issues or warning lights, <a href="http://www.obd-codes.com/trouble_codes/">diagnostic codes</a> will show up automatically in your fleet management system. This helps with both scheduling and preventing unexpected downtime. Statistics like fuel usage, idle time and more are also just a few clicks away. There will typically be an added cost for this type of device, but it is more often than not well worth the investment.</span></span></p><h2><span><span style="font-size:17px">Time Saving Techniques</span></span></h2><p><span><strong>Collaboration</strong></span></p><p><span><span>Fleet management, by nature, touches a lot of employees in your company. Instead of putting all of the responsibility on the shoulders of one person, it is much more efficient to divide up tasks accordingly and let each person contribute in their specific capacity. If a driver is the one taking their vehicle in for maintenance, they can easily add that service record. Same goes with onsite mechanics. We talk to a number of fleets who redundantly transcribe information several times before it ends up in their <a href="http://fleetio.com">software program</a>. With an intuitive program, anyone should be able to do their job quickly with minimal or no training. If you prefer to limit permissions as well as access for users, most online applications will allow the fine-tuning of roles.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Responsive Maintenance Scheduling</strong></span></p><p><span><span>By automating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_maintenance">PM activities</a> start-to-finish, you can drastically cut down on time and headaches. An intelligent maintenance system will allow you to create email reminders that alert appropriate users when a task is due soon, due or overdue. Instead of waiting until that overdue notification, it is in your best interest to get that service on the schedule. This will ensure maintenance gets done in a timely fashion. It also allows for plenty of planning to work around a vehicle that is in the shop.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Centralized Document Storage</strong></span></p><p><span><span>Whether you fall under DOT regulations or not, it is of the utmost importance that you always know where The collective glove boxes and file cabinets at your company simply won’t cut the mustard. Choose a convenient home online where you can upload important photos as well as documents. Then you will always know where to look. If a surprise inspection comes knocking, you and your company will already have those ducks all in a row.</span></span></p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Hiring and Retaining Good Drivers</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52f4f644e4b0bae912c337b1/1391785541690/Wrecked%20Truck%20born1945.jpg" /><p><span><span>A good employee can sometimes seem hard to come by. A good driver can be even more difficult to find. And once you have recruited your top-notch talent, how do you keep them happy and consistently performing at a high level? All questions we will be answering in today’s post. Below are some tips to ensure that you are putting a high quality crew behind the wheel of your fleet.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Lay Out a Detailed Hiring Policy</strong></span></p><p><span><span>Establish a hiring policy specifically for your drivers and enlist the help of a lawyer. Be very clear on the qualifications and expectations required to operate company vehicles and keep it stored in a convenient location like your online <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">fleet management software</a> (wink).</span></span></p><p><span><span>You do not want to completely eliminate the entire job pool, but it might be worth while to require a minimum level of of experience in order to operate certain vehicles. After all, a proven record speaks volumes in contrast to an assumption or promise.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Remember that this new hire will be an ambassador of your brand, and is likely going to be cruising your rolling billboard all around town for everyone to see. Poor maintenance, upkeep and irresponsible driving are going to be in the public eye, so make sure you are defining responsibilities beyond simply operating the vehicle.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Do Your Research</strong></span></p><p><span><span>For serious candidates, a <a href="http://www.jjkeller.com/wcsstore/CVCatalogAssetStore/images/promotions/dq-hiring/Driver-Hiring-Checklist.pdf">background check is absolutely worth the time and money</a>. Be sure to check their references and driving history. Check with your state for a detailed Motor Vehicle Record (MVR).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Incidents where the driver was at fault and traffic violations are certainly red flags. Keep in mind that if that type of behavior continues on your watch, then you are running the risk of losing a lot of money off your bottom line.</span></span></p><p><span><span>When it comes to DOT regulated fleets, you should also keep in mind that points and violations follow the driver to your company.&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://www.businessfleet.com/channel/safety-accident-management/article/story/2013/03/best-practices-in-driver-hiring.aspx">Companies that fall under DOT rules</a> are required to maintain a qualification file for all drivers, including any requirements like road test certificates, a medical examiner’s certificate, driving records, as well as an annual driving review.</p><h3><span><span>Retaining Drivers</span></span></h3><p><span><strong>Open the Lines of Communication</strong></span></p><p><span><span>First and foremost, talk to your drivers. Listen to their issues, suggestions and feedback. Vehicle operators are your eyes and ears in the fleet, so their input can have a big impact. Knowing that their voice matters will keep drivers happier in the long run.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Incentivize Good Performance</strong></span></p><p><span><span>Drivers that are are good at their job will welcome the opportunity to earn more for their safe and efficient behavior. Set goals for such things as fuel efficiency and preventative maintenance fulfillment. Only enlisting negative reinforcement when an employee screws up is a sure fire way to <a href="http://hni.com/blog/bid/76274/Retaining-Drivers-First-Who-Then-What">increase your turnover rate</a>.

      <title>How Taxes Can Impact Your Fleet</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/2/how-taxes-can-impact-your-fleet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52f18881e4b0cdd19982fe5a/1391560835070/Taxes.jpg" /><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Who’s excited? Today on the Fleetio Blog, we are talking about everyone’s favorite subject, taxes. You might be inclined to skip over this one, but here’s why you should care. Just like preventative maintenance and other responsible fleet management practices, you may not be generating income, but you can surely save your company a great deal of money (and headaches) by considering the following tips.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Business vs. Personal Mileage</strong></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">If you haven’t already, it is important that you <a href="http://www.automotive-fleet.com/blog/market-trends/story/2010/04/5-avoidable-mistakes-in-managing-personal-use.aspx?prestitial=1">establish a clear policy about what denotes personal and business mileage at your company</a>. Fuel is one of your largest regular expenses, and even if you are great at reducing these costs, much of it can fly out the window if you let employees rack up undocumented personal miles. Even if your company views a take-home vehicle as a perk, the driver should still understand that personal miles are taxable income and should be accounted for.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">To make it a regular habit, I would suggest setting a weekly or monthly reminder for your drivers to update their mileage and send them to an easily accessible fleet management system, shared document or spreadsheet. If this is done too infrequently, a lot of guesswork could be involved in the numbers.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Vehicle Depreciation</strong></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Of the low-hanging fruit that will save you on taxes, recognizing depreciation among your assets is pretty effortless deduction. Typical depreciation <a href="http://www.fleetfinancials.com/channel/leasing/article/story/2012/09/there-s-no-escaping-fleet-and-taxes/page/2.aspx">20% of the value each year</a>, essentially putting the “usable life” (as far as the government is concerned) on a 5 year cycle. If you are leasing vehicles, however, the owner gets to count this depreciation while you can only factor in the lease amount as an expense for the company. &nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">It might be a close call, but those leased vehicles may not be saving you in the long run. Either way, it’s worth considering tax implications in the annual operational cost.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Alternative Fuel Tax Credit</strong></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">You have undoubtedly considered an alternative fuel option or two as a proactive fleet manager. Tax season is an annual reminder that you could be getting rewarded for switching to something besides gasoline or diesel. Check out what you could have deducted in 2013 and do a little research what credits (state and federal) are available and see if this is the year to make a change.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">If you happen to be alternatively fueling any of your vehicles or equipment with your own facilities (either with a station or canister refiller), then you <a href="http://www.greenfleetmagazine.com/article/51760/alternative-fuel-tax-credits-for-fleets">could receive a $0.50 per gallon credit</a>. Qualifying methods include CNG as well as p</span><span style="font-size:13px">ropane autogas in reusable canisters that powers equipment such as forklifts and airport tugs. Check out the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8849.pdf">Fuel Excise Tax Return</a> if you apply.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Over the Road Requirements</strong></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">If you are an over the road or trucking company, then you have more tax considerations to be mindful of. The Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax is a per-vehicle annual assessment based weight. The filing period, unlike your regular taxes, falls in August and represents the previous 12 months. Your only way to avoid this one is to keep a fleet vehicle under 5,000 miles (7,500 for agricultural vehicles) annually, in which case you still have to file but do not owe anything. You can find the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2290.pdf">IRS form here</a></span><span style="font-size:13px">.</span></span></p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Challenges for Fleets in the United Kingdom</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/1/challenges-for-fleets-in-the-united-kingdom</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52ea79cae4b02f002106a523/1391098317960/UK%20Truck%20Backing%20Paulio!.jpg" /><p>Although Fleetio is a US-based company, we currently have customers in over 25 different countries around the world, including quite a few the United Kingdom. Admittedly, our team tends to write articles primarily around operating a fleet in North America, but we like to touch on other areas as well. &nbsp;Having recently spent some time in England and Scotland, I feel like this is a great time to talk about the issues facing fleets in the United Kingdom.</p><p><strong><span><span>A Close Eye on Tyres</span></span></strong></p><p><span><span>Since we are on the other side of the pond today, I’ll happily oblige the British spelling of our rubbery assets. Whereas good tyre management is highly recommended in the US, it is actually the law in the UK. </span><span>The legal limit for minimum tread depth is 1.6 millimetres, which has to be maintained around the entire circumference. If your good judgement lapses and you choose to go too long without a fresh set, then you could be awarded penalty points and a hefty fine.</span></span></p><p style="margin-right:19pt"><span><span>Adding to the scrutiny, there is also the requirement for your tyres to be compatible with the other types fitted to the vehicle. Any visible <a href="http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/legal-advice/tyres.html">bulge, tear or rip in the cord</a> will get you docked as well.</span></span></p><p><span><span>So, with the compounded challenge of running an entire fleet of vehicles, how do you best manage tyre replacement? First off, it is suggested that instead of getting down to the absolute minimum, you should schedule to get new rubber at around a <a href="http://www.kwik-fit.com/uk-tyre-law.asp">3 mm tread depth</a>. Have your drivers and mechanics keep a tyre gauge handy, plan regular (daily or weekly) inspections, and update measurements regularly in your fleet management software.</span></span></p><p><strong><span><span>The Cost of Fuel</span></span></strong></p><p><span><span>In America, we consider $4 per gallon to be outlandish. Rounding out 2013, petrol prices in the United Kingdom were north of 6£ (almost $10) per gallon. As you might imagine, this changes priorities a bit when it comes to managing expenses. If there was ever an environment conducive to pro-active fuel management, this is the place. It is extremely important for fleets to spec the appropriate vehicles and keep a close eye on vehicle weight, engine displacement and responsible driving. You also might want to consider fuel cards for bulk discounts and tighter purchasing controls.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Given the cost of petrol, alternative fuels very much enter the conversation if you are managing a fleet in the UK. Diesel, EVs, and biofuels are all very much in play, especially with <a href="http://green.autoblog.com/2012/01/23/u-k-extends-ev-tax-credit-to-2015-adds-utility-vehicles/">applicable tax credits</a>.</span></span></p><p><strong><span><span>MOT Inspection</span></span></strong></p><p><span><span>For every vehicle in your fleet over 3 years old, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) requires an annual inspection/test to ensure that a vehicle falls within the requirements for emissions, roadworthiness and safety. Instead of waiting until the notice comes out, it would be worth setting an annual reminder for each of your vehicles and being proactive about scheduling.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Once you have the inspection certificate and record, be sure to store a copy online in addition to having one in the vehicle itself.</span></span></p><p><strong><span><span>Reducing CO2 Emissions</span></span></strong></p><p><span><span>Due to strict requirements, a fleet manager in the UK has to be cognizant of the CO2 emissions released by their vehicles. Cooperating with the current threshold will save you money on fleet operations, so it is a good idea to do your homework before purchasing a new or used vehicle. The MOT has an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/co2-and-vehicle-tax-tools">easy lookup tool</a></span><span>&nbsp;and a good target is below <a href="http://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/2013/3/11/co2-policies-help-fleets-negate-leasing-tax-change/46426/">130g/km of CO2 per vehicle</a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>We hope this information helps!

      <title>Should You Switch Tires for Winter Driving?</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/1/should-you-switch-tires-for-winter-driving</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52e112ece4b0b11bf7e51be3/1390482158679/Snow%20Tires%20Trace%20Meek.jpg" /><p>We are well into January already, and most of you in the northern United States and Canada are probably quite fed up with snow by now. It has been a strange winter for sure, and more is to come. At some point, you may have found yourself wondering if your fleet vehicles should be on more weather-appropriate tires for these difficult driving conditions. Others might be second-guessing the choice to drop money on making the switch. Either way, we have compiled some expert opinions on the subject of winter-weather tires and whether or not they might be a good move for your fleet.</p><p><strong>Things to Consider</strong></p><p>For those of you who experience prolonged and seemingly never-ending winters, the choice to switch could be a little easier. We have turned to our Canadian friends for advice on the topic. According to the Vancouver Sun, an <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/great+snow+tire+debate+changing+your+tires+worth+time+cost/9140447/story.html">average of 50 percent of vehicles in British Columbia will adopt snow tires</a> each year as the season moves in. A winter tire is typically going to get 20-25% better grip in snow &amp; ice, which could give your company a little reassurance that drivers are better prepared for these conditions. Keep in mind, if your fleet tends to be out on the road in early-morning or evening scenarios, the need for better grip is going to increase dramatically.</p><p>Also remember that temperature should really be the main guiding factor, as winter tires are made of a softer compound better suited to colder weather.&nbsp;Winter tires should typically be used when you expect&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/car-tips/14-reasons-to-ditch-your-all-season-tires-for-the-winter/article15295871/?page=all">temperatures to fall below 44 degrees F (7 C)</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Which Winter Tire is Best?</strong></p><p>As with any type of tire, there are going to be a lot of options, so which ones should you choose? Well, it really depends on where you will be driving. Some fleets prefer a tire that is more of a hybrid between an all-weather and a snow model. This is going to fit well with climates that don't receive a lot of regular snowfall, but get that occasional spell of bad weather.&nbsp;</p><p>Mountainous regions, with rougher terrain, are going to require a more serious tire. Something with a more aggressive tread pattern might do the trick, but would be less optimal for low-lying regions that have slippery roads and ice. Regardless of which tire you choose, it is important to closely monitor tread wear throughout the season. Winter tires, especially on normal roads, are going to wear out much faster than their all-weather counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever you choose to go with, it might be a good idea to keep these alternate tires <a href="http://www.driverside.com/auto-library/how_and_when_to_change_from_summer_to_winter_tires-37">on a separate set of wheels </a>with the same lug pattern. Given the usable life of this extra rubber, you will more than likely have them for at least a few seasons and making it easy to switch back and forth will save you a headache, even though there will be some added expense required.</p><p><strong>Track Performance for Better Decisions</strong></p><p>Adding a set of 4 will cost upward of $120 per tire, but it is important that you use information at hand to make educated decisions about such an investment. Utilize your <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">fleet management software</a> to set inspection reminders and record your assessment regularly. If you are trying out winter tires on just a few vehicles, tracking their performance, fuel economy, extra maintenance will important for making a good evaluation.</p><p> </p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Future of Google Glass in Your Fleet</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/1/the-future-of-google-glass-in-your-fleet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52dfa1c2e4b0cad36167ea19/1390387653117/Google%20Glass%20HUD%20Richard%20Masoner.jpg" /><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Who would have thought that one speeding ticket could have such a large impact on the tech community? A judge in California <a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/jan/16/google-glass-goes-to-trial/">recently dismissed a ticket</a> that was handed out to a driver wearing <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass</a>. While the ruling is mostly limited to this particular case (and there is still much to be debated on the legality of utilizing Google Glass while driving) such a decision could potentially open the door for a number of integrated applications on this and similar platforms. We will touch on a few of them and highlight some differing opinions on whether this new technology is a distraction or step forward for driver safety.</span></span></p><p><strong>An Optimistic Outlook</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">According to a story from DigitalTrends.com, <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/despite-the-uks-idiocy-google-glass-could-be-a-godsend-for-safe-driving/">Google Glass could be “the most beneficial gadget to ever enter the vehicle.”</a> While it could certainly be argued that increased connectivity for a vehicle operator might lead to increased distraction (ie checking email, internet browsing), the flipside is that some applications could be likened to a more intelligent heads-up display (HUD).</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Navigation, weather conditions and car functionality could all be fed to the driver without their eyes ever leaving the road. When you compare this to turning knobs, pressing buttons and turning your focus to a smartphone, it is definitely seen as an improvement. What will still be debated, however, is whether “eyes on the road” directly correlates to increased concentration. Studies have previously shown that, even with a hands-free device and focus straight ahead, talking on the phone is still a dangerous distraction.</span></span></p><p><strong>Backlash and Debate</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">While Google Glass is still only the hands of developers, the impending release to consumers will certainly drum up a lot of debate on how safe it really is for you to operate a vehicle and this device at the same time. <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/743396/How_Safe_is_Google_Glass_for_Driving_">Several states and the United Kingdom have already hinted at banning Google Glass</a> while behind the wheel. Like anything else, the technology could and certainly will be abused, but along the same vein as cell phone blockers and other add-ons, ways to restrict use while operating a fleet vehicle could be made available.</span></span></p><p><strong>Potential for the Future</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">The potential is obviously huge for what could be done with this increased connectivity, especially when it comes to business applications and a fleet of vehicles. Just as companies today have been in a rush to utilize smartphone applications in their daily routines, we could soon see custom apps for the connected driver.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">You can use your imagination when it comes to the possible uses for a HUD that is easily controlled with eye movement. Routing instructions could easily be updated on the fly. Vehicle diagnostics and trouble codes could be sent directly to your vehicle maintenance software and the right mechanic could be found in seconds. When it comes to the potential for added safety, there is already an app available for Google Glass that <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/drivesafe-app-google-glass/30465/">keeps drivers awake and alert</a></span><span style="font-size:15px">. Hyundai has even gone as far as adding a Google Glass app that allows for advanced <a href="http://www.automotive-fleet.com/channel/gps-telematics/news/story/2014/01/hyundai-adds-google-glass-app-to-15-genesis.aspx">interaction with their 2015 Genesis</a>&nbsp;model.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">What will the long term impact be for consumers, companies and fleets? Only time will tell...</span></span></p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Importance of Driver Buy-In</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/1/the-importance-of-driver-buy-in</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52d5a786e4b077750335b8f2/1389733862193/Delivery%20Driver%20UDSAgov.jpg" /><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">For a company that utilizes vehicles or equipment to get the job done, little can top the importance of fleet maintenance and care of these expensive assets. Your employees, however, are entirely instrumental in getting the most out of this equipment. They also have to be counted on to perform their work safely and efficiently.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Some administrators see their employees as a liability or an accident waiting to happen, but they are vital to your business and can be the basis of a smooth running fleet. With the right motivation and encouragement, drivers can provide valuable information that saves your business in operating costs over time. Here are some great reasons why employees are essential to great fleet management.</span></span></p><h3><span>Using Their Senses</span></h3><p><span style="font-size:15px">We beat motorsports analogies to death here on the <a href="http://fleetio.com/blog">Fleetio Blog</a>, but there are plenty of correlations to be made. Just like in racing, the feel that a driver has is extremely important, and is usually your first line of defense for any vehicle issues. The <a href="http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-tests/why-does-your-steering-wheel-shake-when-braking.htm">feedback that a car gives</a>; through the steering wheel, seat or brake pedal can pay huge dividends if an operator is paying attention. An employee without a sense of responsibility, however, could easily glaze over these problems and let them go until major (and expensive) service is required.</span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">So how do you motivate your drivers to care? For starters, it’s pretty simple: ask for their feedback. Encourage regular updates and early detection. After all, wouldn’t you rather fix the small issues instead of big ones? Keep the conversation open and you won’t have to. Secondly, if you are <a href="http://fleetio.com/vhm">monitoring performance,</a> you may see problems coming from a mile away. If the cost/mile for a vehicle is steadily going up, fuel mileage is suffering or an in-car unit shows abusive driving, then you should probably talk to the driver.</span></span></p><h3><span>Matching the Vehicles to the Job</span></h3><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">As a high-level manager, it might be easy to spec out a generic vehicle and <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/6/tips-for-fleet-vehicle-purchasing">make purchasing decisions</a> purely on cost. Sometimes, this works out, but usually it doesn’t. A vehicle needs to be an extension of your business, and therefore work in sync with the job you are trying to do. If a driver or employee is hindered by the limitations of a vehicle, then you are ultimately costing the company time and money. Unless you are a out there every day doing the work yourself, then it would be a good idea to sit down with your operators and see what vehicle features, options, and functionality would allow them to do their work more effectively.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">There is a second benefit of this conversation: prevention. On-the-job incidents, even if minor, are very costly to your bottom line. From both a <a href="http://www.healthandsafetyatwork.com/hsw/content/focus-ergonomics">safety and ergonomic perspective</a>, it is important that everyone is taken care of. Have your employees walk through their daily routines and point out potential hazards. The fix could be as simple as making it easier to get in and out of their truck.</span></span></p><h3><span>Pitching in on Preventative Maintenance</span></h3><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Unless your vehicles are Kip-like and having daily conversations with company management, your drivers are a necessary link to the condition and service schedules for the fleet. Of course it is a little bit of a hassle to schedule an oil change or other important maintenance, but the collective discomfort pales in comparison to replacing an engine and being down a truck for a few weeks.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Reward those who adhere to your <a href="http://www.businessfleet.com/channel/leasing/article/story/2012/07/how-to-start-a-preventive-maintenance-plan-for-a-small-fleet.aspx">maintenance plan</a> and easily monitor compliance with <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-managment-software">fleet management software</a>. With regular email reminders as well as on-the-go data entry, there really is no excuse for missing an important service. Just let your employees know that they have a stake in the performance of your fleet. With them on board, your vehicle operations can be a breeze.</span></span></p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Selecting a Fuel Card for Your Fleet</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/1/how-to-select-a-fuel-card-for-your-fleet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52cdcb27e4b03a0e4eb06055/1389218600441/Fuel%20Card%20used%20at%20pump%20CHS%20Inc.jpg" /><p>As we have discussed many times before on the <a href="http://fleetio.com/blog">Fleetio Blog</a>, useful information is key to great fleet management. With Fuel being one of your largest ongoing expenses, it only makes complete sense to closely monitor fuel consumption for your vehicles. With fuel cards (and <a href="http://fleetio.com/fuel-cards">fleet software integration</a>) this process can be easily manageable. With that in mind, our team has compiled a list of options and what determining factors you might want to consider in choosing cards for your fleet.</p><h2>Things to Consider</h2><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p>Before you start the search for a fuel card that will meet the needs of your fleet, it might be a good idea to think about exactly what those needs are. First off, where will you be using the cards? Some fuel card companies only operate in certain countries or regions. Others may only be accepted at specific stations. Those with fewer options in their operating territory may want to be careful about limiting drivers to just a few stations. &nbsp;This could lead to your employees burning up a bunch of extra fuel and valuable time finding a gas pump. If availability is in question, then a universally accepted card (Mastercard, Visa, etc.) may be your best bet.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong></p><p>It may sound a bit confusing, but the price you see at the pump is not always what you get with fuel card purchasing. Certain products will allow you to batch your fuel purchases and issue volume-based pricing after a certain period. This has potential to save your company money, but could come with added requirements or fees that other cards may not. The key here is to have an idea of what you are currently spending on fuel (where is also important) and if that trend will continue, increase or decline in the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>Here is one of the biggest differences between a typical credit card and a fuel card: control. You can pretty much limit your card users however you would like. Cards may be restricted to the pump, or pump and convenience store, or they might be usable for vehicle service. Either way, you know that employees are much less likely to abuse a company card. To keep them from loading up on free gas, you can consider the next topic on our list.</p><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p><p>If you are simply getting a statement at the end of the month, then you aren't doing enough with your fuel expenses. A number of fleet management products now integrate with major fuel card providers and can create a direct link to the rest of your vehicle information. With this handy data, you can get an overall cost/mile for your vehicles, see automatic fuel economy calculations, monitor irregular fuel purchases and more. Simply put, tying your purchases to an integrated system is going to put all of your important fleet information in one location - making for much better analysis and decision making.</p><p> </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52cefd40e4b0f0ed24088bd1/1389297054236/Fuel%20Prices.jpg" /><h2>Major Card Providers</h2><p>There are quite a few players in the fuel card industry, but a handful of names make up the majority of fleet cards in the US and internationally. In this list, we'll highlight a few of their notable differences and give you an idea of what might suit your company best.</p><h3><strong>Fleetcards USA</strong></h3><p><a href="http://www.fleetcardsusa.com/">Fleetcards USA</a> (owned by <a href="http://fleetcor.com">Fleetcor</a>) offers a handful of popular brands in the United States. &nbsp;Their products are usually a good fit for smaller to medium-sized fleets, but they do have larger customers as well.</p><p>Here is a list of cards offered by Fleetcards USA:</p><p><a href="http://www.fuelman.com/universal-premium-mastercard-details.aspx"><strong>Universal Premium Fleet Card</strong></a></p><p>This Mastercard-backed product is widely accepted and can be used for a variety of fleet purchases. Close to half of <a href="http://www.automotive-fleet.com/channel/fuel-management/article/story/2007/09/how-to-select-a-fuel-management-provider.aspx">larger fleets (50+ vehicles) choose a universal option</a> due to flexibility and ease of use.</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.fuelman.com/index.aspx">Fuelman</a></strong></p><p>Offers pricing programs within the Fuelman Network, this card features wholesale-based pricing and special discount programs. These cards can also be used for maintenance purchases.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.fleetcardsusa.com/arco_business_solutions_fuel_card_programs.aspx">ARCO</a></strong></p><p>ARCO's Business Solutions program provides useful features, benefits and controls for every driver in your fleet. They promise savings compared to other retailers and offer real-time account information online.</p><p><a href="http://www.fleetcardsusa.com/bp_business_solutions_fuel_card_programs.aspx"><strong>BP Business Solutions</strong></a></p><p>This card has customized account settings to best suit your business. BP Business Solutions gives control over fuel purchases (like gallon limits) while saving on fuel costs. Accepted at over 10,000 BP locations and account information is available online.</p><p><a href="http://www.fleetcardsusa.com/chevron_texaco_business_card_programs.aspx"><strong>Chevron &amp; Texaco Business</strong></a></p><p>Has customized tools to help control, monitor and analyze fleet&nbsp;fuel expenses. Accepted at Chevron &amp; Texaco stations nationwide. Also valid at Havoline Xpress Lube locations.</p><p><strong>WEX</strong></p><p>Formally known as Wright Express, <a href="http://www.wexinc.com/">WEX</a> has a global presence and a diverse array of fuel card products.

      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we have discussed many times before on the Fleetio Blog, useful information is key to great fleet management. With Fuel being one of your largest ongoing expenses, it only makes complete sense to closely monitor fuel consumption for your vehicles. With fuel cards (and fleet software integration) this process can be easily manageable. With that in mind, our team has compiled a list of options and what determining factors you might want to consider in choosing cards for your fleet.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>New in Fleetio: "Watch" a Vehicle for Automatic Notifications</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/1/new-in-fleetio-watch-a-vehicle-for-automatic-notifications</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52cead46e4b0c18dd2d0cef1/1389276489430/tumblr_mw87niutZp1sfie3io1_1280.jpg" /><p>Keeping a watchful eye on your vehicles is one of the primary benefits of a computerized fleet management system like Fleetio. </p>

<p>However, it can be a challenge to keep up with everything in a multi-user environment. People often revert to email discussions about their vehicles when an issue or question comes up.</p>

<p>The problem with plain ol' email is those conversation threads are essentially lost once the discussion ends. The conversation is not easily attached to the vehicle’s history even though an important decision may have been made during the back-and-forth.</p>

<p>Today we’re making it easier for teams to collaborate around a vehicle directly in Fleetio. </p>

<p>Fleetio has always had the ability to make comments on vehicles, service and fuel entries, and more - but now when you make a comment an email notification will be sent to other people on your team.</p>

<h2 id="howdoesitwork">How does it work?</h2>

<p>We’re introducing a new concept called “watching” a vehicle. This is essentially a way to keep an eye on a vehicle and be automatically notified when certain things happen.</p>

<p>We’re starting with comments. When another user makes a comment on a vehicle you watch, you’ll automatically receive an email with the content of the user’s comment.</p>

<p>Our goal was to make it easy to pick and choose which vehicles you want to be notified about, and Fleetio will handle the rest.</p>

<p>We’ve even made it easy to pick and choose which notifications you receive. Starting today your preference choices include vehicle comments, service entry comments, fuel entry comments.</p>

<p>If you’re a <a href="/vhm">VHM customer</a>, you can even receive DTC (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs">Diagnostic Trouble Code</a>) alert notifications for watched vehicles.</p>

<p>We’ll be adding more preference choices and automatic notifications soon. Let us know if you have any thoughts or ideas.</p>

<h2 id="watchingavehicle">Watching a vehicle</h2>

<p>Just click the “Watch” button on the main vehicle profile screen for any vehicle you want to watch. You can even see how many users are watching a vehicle, too.</p>

<p>By the way, you can easily watch or “unwatch” all vehicles at once from the Watched Vehicles list.</p>

<p>There are even some handy preferences for automatically watching new vehicles, too.</p>

<h2 id="goingforward">Going forward</h2>

<p>This is an important update for Fleetio as it lays the groundwork for better and more personal notifications going forward.</p>

<p>Be sure to check out the Help Center articles for <a href="http://help.fleetio.com/article/61-watching-a-vehicle">watching a vehicle</a> and <a href="http://help.fleetio.com/article/62-notification-settings">managing your notification preferences</a>.</p>

<p>We hope you find it helpful and even easier to keep a watchful eye over your fleet. We look forward to hearing your feedback.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Then and now, the publication does a great job of hinting at what the future will bring. Being somewhat of a gearhead, articles on flying and self-driving cars were fascinating to me, but always felt a bit distant. And, as one might quickly realize, the autopilot feature would have to come first, as we have enough terrible drivers already with our cars sitting on the ground. So I waited...</p>

<h4 id="thegooglecar">The Google Car</h4>

<p>By now, you have undoubtedly heard about <a href="http://www.google.com/about/jobs/lifeatgoogle/self-driving-car-test-steve-mahan.html">Google’s self-driving car</a>. The retrofitted Toyota Prius has, over the last few years, completed challenging routes totalling thousands of miles without any human assistance. Google, however, will be the first to tell you that they aren’t 100% there yet. Reading this <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/11/25/131125fa_fact_bilge">extremely detailed profile of their operation</a>, you get an idea of the seemingly infinite situations an automated car has to accommodate. </p>

<p>To give an example, if you (a human, we'll assume) are driving down the interstate at respectable 60 mph (~87 feet/second) and a piece of debris is sitting in your lane, what is your immediate thought process? You will likely evaluate the obstacle first. If there’s a paper sack in your path, then you probably shouldn’t slam on your brakes and risk a rear-end collision. This is a split-second decision that involves a number of complicated factors. In this case, how do you teach artificial intelligence to recognize nuances like material makeup (even if that bag is crumpled) at highway speeds?</p>

<p>So you see, there are plenty of challenges ahead for 100% automated driving, but we are still told that such cars could be here by 2020. In the meantime, it should be noted that scaled down versions of this technology is already readily available. You might think you are still totally in charge, but here are some prime examples that you indeed are not, and haven’t been for a while. Cue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68I3j2luW64">Terminator theme song</a>…</p>

<h4 id="theriseofthemachines">The Rise of the Machines</h4>

<p>The first time I saw a commercial for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsLNNkfSoYI">self-parallel parking Lexus</a>, the hair literally stood up on the back of my neck (“IT DOES WHAT?!”). Traction control, ABS and various other computerized "intelligent" features have been around for years, but this was an entirely different level. The steering wheel had been taken from us. Now, it seems, most major auto manufacturers have similar functionality as an option in their vehicles. </p>

<p>Beyond parking, other new features are focused intently on compensating for your flawed human-ness. With so many distractions behind the wheel, there are now a myriad of safety options to correct potential mistakes. Automatic braking is a prime example of this. Whether you are backing up with limited vision or going forwards and simply not paying attention, there are a number of cars that will now stop for you. If you happen to be running a company and have a fleet of vehicles out on the road, it could certainly add peace of mind to know that your drivers have help in staying safe. For a full rundown of who has the best performing systems, check out CNN Money’s article on <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/27/autos/iihs-crash-avoidance/">accident avoidance ratings</a>. As you’ll see, some cars are equipped to slow you down automatically and others will actually bring the car to a full (and jarring) stop.</p>

<h4 id="thefutureisalreadyhere">The Future is Already Here</h4>

<p>If you want to see the cutting edge of what safety features are currently available to the general public, albeit the wealthy general public, check out the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/gallery/autos/2013/07/26/mercedes-benz-s-class-review/index.html?iid=EL">2014 Mercedes S-Class</a> ($93,000 base). With the S-Class, Mercedes is basically knocking on the door of a complete self-driving car. In addition to regular or parallel parking itself and braking automatically, the vehicle can keep a safe distance from those ahead and literally steer you down the highway. Check out <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/27/autos/iihs-crash-avoidance/">the video</a> if you want to see it in action. </p>

<p>As with any advanced technology, one would expect the price of these sophisticated options to trickle down and become more accessible for the masses. Subaru, a notable fleet vehicle provider, is already one of the highest rated when it comes to accident avoidance technology and their prices are more in line with what the everyday consumer is willing to spend.</p>

<p>There are a lot of hurdles to a 100% self-driving car, but in just seeing what is available as we speak, it doesn’t seem like too distant of a future. You might want to prepare yourself for that day, as it will be here sooner than you think. And once we get that far, the logical next step is up.</p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up, I was an avid reader of <em>Popular Mechanics</em> magazine. Then and now, the publication does a great job of hinting at what the future will bring. Being somewhat of a gearhead, articles on flying and self-driving cars were fascinating to me, but always felt a bit distant. And, as one might quickly realize, the autopilot feature would have to come first, as we have enough terrible drivers already with our cars sitting on the ground. So I waited...</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Fleetio Update: Account-Wide Enhancements &amp; Vehicles Without Service Report</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/12/fleetio-update-account-wide-enhancements-vehicles-without-service-report</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52aa2863e4b0cb06a58fcafd/1386883309674/placeit.png" /><p>The latest update in <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleetio</a> is all about giving you a better view and more control when it comes to your fleet. Our account-wide features now make it easy to see, filter and update the Reminders, Service Entries and Fuel Entries for all your vehicles. We've also added a new Report that allows you to find vehicles that have not received service. So yeah, we've been pretty busy.</p>

<h4 id="serviceentriestab">Service Entries Tab</h4>

<p>As with all of these new features, the Service Entries tab is located in the black sidebar on the left of your Fleetio account and is accessible from any page. Simply click on the Service Entries tab to get started. From the new page you can quickly see all Services performed over the life of your account. Use our filters to select a given time range, specific services, vehicles or vendors. </p>

<h4 id="fuelentriestab">Fuel Entries Tab</h4>

<p>The new Fuel Entries page works much like the Service Entries page and gives you a complete list of fuel records. This is a great way to quickly identify any invalid meter entries and update them to the correct reading.</p>

<h4 id="servicerenewalremindertabs">Service &amp; Renewal Reminder Tabs</h4>

<p>You'll like this: with our new Reminder tabs, you can filter, update and <a href="http://help.fleetio.com/article/57-adding-users-to-multiple-reminders">manage subscribers in bulk</a>. You might also notice the new "Add Multiple Reminders" button in the top right of the page. This handy new tool is going to revolutionize the way you setup new Reminders. Just select the Service (or Renewal) Type, choose an interval, and then you can include as many vehicles and users as you want. Time officially saved!</p>

<h4 id="vehicleswithoutservicereport">Vehicles Without Service Report</h4>

<p>If you want to find vehicles that haven't had particular services, then we have a great new tool for you. On the reporting screen, you'll now see the <a href="http://help.fleetio.com/article/58-vehicles-without-service-report">Vehicles Without Service Report</a>. The list will default to vehicles that haven't had any services performed, but you can select a time frame and/or a service type to see what hasn't been done. </p>

<p>Visit our <a href="http://help.fleetio.com">Help Center</a> (which is now new and improved!) for more information on these features. If you have a question or simply want to see how our features work, the information in our Help Centery is seconds away. </p>

      <title>The Benefits (and How-Tos) of Lowering CO2 Emissions Across A Fleet</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/12/the-benefits-and-how-tos-of-lowering-co2-emissions-across-a-fleet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/529f57dee4b0736bd37b4914/1386174435345/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-04%20at%2010.26.48%20AM.png.48%20AM.png?format=original" /><p>Most developed countries made a commitment in line with the Kyoto protocol and other objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the year 2050. Considerable reductions are called for and this has in part led to individual government pressure on the automobile sector to increase efficiencies. </p>

<p>While this process is ongoing, progress is likely to be relatively slow, as is research into creating more sustainable fuels. There are a few research bodies (such as the US company <a href="http://www.poly2petro.com">Poly2Petro</a>) who are making headway into creating viable methods of generating more oil, but the fact remains that oil is still a very finite resource and the more efficiently we use it, the lower our carbon footprint (and additionally our fleet overheads).</p>

<p>And individual businesses do understand the importance of trying to reduce their overall carbon footprint, both from an ecological point of view but increasingly from an economic perspective as well. Remember that there's much to be gained not only from a purely competitive point of view, but also from a public relations stance, when progress is considerable and reportable.</p>

<p>For generations, we have been forced to utilize transportation options that were totally reliant on oil. However, today this is not the case and fleet managers can look to employ more efficient, lower carbon transport technology. Managers can consider these options based on realistic range and capacity today, a situation that has improved dramatically over the last decade.</p>

<h3 id="typesofvehicleandfueloptions">Types of Vehicle and Fuel Options</h3>

<p>Hybrid vehicles typically have two sources of energy, where an electric motor is used to supplement a conventional internal combustion engine. All-electric vehicles have more limited capability. Gas powered vehicles utilize biomethane, hydrogen or natural gas. Dual fuel vehicles have the ability to combust both diesel and gas in a conventional engine.</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/529f58dde4b00096a05e08df/1386174687766/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-04%20at%2010.30.54%20AM.png.54%20AM.png?format=original" /><p>There are a number of different fuel options, some of which are more practical from a fleet manager’s perspective than others. Bioethanol, for example is in limited supply and can be relatively costly. Biodiesel is dependent on availability and the higher the concentration, the higher the cost. Hydrogen can also be significantly more expensive but has the greatest capability when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<h3 id="savingswithexistingfleetvehicles">Savings With Existing Fleet Vehicles</h3>

<p>Bearing in mind the restrictions in availability for certain fuels and/or the practicality of equipping a fleet using these alternatives many fleet managers find that they need to look for efficiencies in other ways. For example, it is possible to achieve fuel savings of up to <a href="http://www.pvsvehicletracking.com/eco/">15% by installing onboard systems</a>, or by initiating a process of driver training. Onboard driver aid systems discourage aggressive acceleration or braking and encourage predictive driving activities. </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/529f5a9ee4b03ec9dbc42673/1386175136951/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-04%20at%2010.38.20%20AM.png.20%20AM.png?format=original" /><p>Drivers are advised to anticipate road conditions, to change up when revs are between 2000 and 2500 RPM. These days there is no need to idle in order to heat an engine from cold first thing in the morning and it is entirely efficient to turn off and restart a modern engine when waiting for an extended period of time. Drivers who are experienced in a particular area should know when and where to drive in order to avoid congestion and road works.</p>

<p>Tire pressures should be checked regularly as underinflated tires can increase your consumption by as much as 3%.</p>

<h3 id="abreathoffreshair">A Breath of Fresh Air</h3>

<p>When it comes to the condition of the vehicle, <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-maintenance-software">regular maintenance is essential</a>. An engine that is out of tune can increase your fuel consumption by up to 10% as can a clogged air filter that needs to be changed. If your tires and wheels are poorly maintained, add on a further 10% here, according to figures given by the UK Department for Transport. You may also encounter a false saving by using a cheaper, incorrect grade of motor oil.</p>

<h3 id="putitonthecard">Put it On The Card</h3>

<p>The use of special fuel oil cards is a great idea for fleet managers. The card suppliers and an integration with your <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">fleet management software</a> can provide special reports detailing fuel consumption and emissions, highlighting inefficiencies and poorly performing drivers.</p>

<p>Take a good look at the routes that your fleet covers on a particular day, and consider tools to optimize your route selection to automatically save fuel and time. If your transport vehicles return empty to your depot, look into the possibility of selling the onboard space through brokerage firms to other organizations. This will help with the sheer cost to your balance sheet and in terms of carbon emissions when engaged in empty backhauling. </p>

<h3 id="overtoyou">Over To You</h3>

<p>Check out some of our previous posts for further info on some of the tools at your disposal to increase efficiency, and as always, let us know in the comments below if you’ve got a tip we haven’t covered here.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tools for Inspecting Your Fleet</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/11/tools-for-inspecting-your-fleet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/528e68b4e4b051a7f10628e7/1385064631337/Screen%20Shot%202013-11-21%20at%202.07.32%20PM.png.32%20PM.png?format=original" /><p>In order to perform a regular thorough inspection of your fleet of vehicles, there are only a few items that you will need to have handy. These tools, which are readily available <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vehicle+inspection+tools&amp;oq=vehicle+inspection+tools&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.3988j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8#es_sm=91&amp;espv=210&amp;q=vehicle+inspection+tools&amp;tbm=shop">online</a> or at your local auto parts store, provide basic measurements for your visual inspection and will assist in giving detailed information to your maintenance provider, saving you time and money.</p>

<h4 id="adjustablemirror">Adjustable Mirror</h4>

<p>The mirror helps you to check the bottom side of the main hoses from the radiator for leaks, inspect the thermostat housing for leaks and look for any lubricant and other fluid leaks in hard to see areas. It also saves you from having to crawl up under the vehicle.</p>

<h4 id="coolanttester">Coolant Tester</h4>

<p>The simple 5 ball float coolant tester pictured above is a very inexpensive and used to <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-test-the-quality-of-your-engine-coolantanti.html">evaluate the quality of your radiator fluid</a>. Ideally, when sampling the fluid, you want all 5 balls to float which indicates a -40 degree F freeze protection. The lower the freeze protection indicated also translates to a higher boiling temperature protecting from overheat situations.  Change the coolant at the recommended schedule. For most car and light trucks this is 5 years or 100,000 miles for extended use coolants. Be sure to let the system cool before testing, and ideally test at the radiator fill rather than the overflow tank.  </p>

<h4 id="pressuregauge">Pressure Gauge</h4>

<p>Use the tire gauge to make sure your tires are set to the recommended pressures. A sticker on the lower part of the driver door frame will list the manufacturer specs. A pressure sealing cap should be on each tire inflation valve to insure no leaks from the stem end. Keep extras on hand just in case.  </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/528e7a1be4b0a636d24cf1cb/1385069085102/Screen%20Shot%202013-11-21%20at%202.09.25%20PM.png.25%20PM.png?format=original" /><h4 id="treaddepthgauge">Tread Depth Gauge</h4>

<p>The tread gauge gives you a clear measure of remaining tread depth and remaining life for your tires. Each tire has raised “bumps” inside the deep tread groves which typically indicate 2/32” of tread remaining, the minimum safe depth. Ideally you do not want to let your tires <a href="http://www.tirebuyer.com/education/how-to-measure-tread-depth">wear to this point</a>. To measure, use a tread groove about mid-way from center line of the tire to the edge. Place the gauge over the groove and lightly press until it bottoms out and read the number on the gauge.</p>

<h4 id="serpentinebeltgrooveweargauge">Serpentine Belt Groove Wear Gauge</h4>

<p>The last tool in the photo is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE580547zr8">serpentine belt groove wear gauge</a>. Belts manufactured after the year 2000 do not crack and show visible problems like older belts. This may lead to leaving the belt on too long causing slippage of the belt and possibly leading to overheating, A/C malfunctions and battery charge issues. To use the belt wear gauge, lay the long thin part of the gauge in any of the groves in the serpentine belt. Then rub your finger across the grooves from one side to the other. If you can feel the gauge above the grooves your belt is OK. If you do not feel the gauge above the grooves, it is time to replace the belt. The photo below shows a belt that is worn out. You can see the depth of the grooves and “squaring” of the groove.</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/528e7ac7e4b02ee2b5f74cdf/1385069258475/Screen%20Shot%202013-11-21%20at%202.15.49%20PM.png.49%20PM.png?format=original" /><p>Manufacturers also design the belt tensioner with an indicator. As the belt wears the “wedge” designed on the back of the tensioner rides lower in relation to a gauge. This does not show actual wear of the belt but is useful.</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/528e7b28e4b0786c75f8c639/1385069356051/Screen%20Shot%202013-11-21%20at%202.16.04%20PM.png.04%20PM.png?format=original" /><h4 id="abouttheauthor">About the Author</h4>

      <title>Fleet Management from Your Mobile Device</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/11/fleet-management-on-mobile-devices</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/528535c2e4b0392ea9656e7c/1384461804844/productshot.png" /><p>We have reached an age where you can do just about anything from a mobile device that you can do from a computer. The smartphone and tablet landscape has grown to encompass a vast array of personal, as well as business functions. Why should Fleet Management be any different? Take advantage of these new advances in mobile technology to make your job easier and your vehicles run more efficiently.</p>

<h3 id="onlinesoftwareconnectivity">Online Software Connectivity</h3>

<p>Unlike traditional "downloadable" products, <a href="http://fleetio.com">online fleet software</a> allows you to connect to your information from any internet-connected device; including your smartphone or tablet. This access can come in the form of an app or might simply be available as a mobile version through your browser. </p>

<h3 id="fuelmanagement">Fuel Management</h3>

<p>If you have a few seconds while your vehicle is refueling (which you do, don't lie), then you have ample time to log your fuel purchase via your smartphone. Once you get into a routine, this is second nature. This saves you from having to dig through receipts or statements at the end of the month. With intelligent software, you can also instantly see calculations for average fuel economy between fill-ups and overall cost/mile for vehicle operation.</p>

<h3 id="easyreminders">Easy Reminders</h3>

<p>Chances are, you are already checking email regularly on your phone or tablet. Why not use the convenience of email to keep up with maintenance on your vehicle or fleet of vehicles? With <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/help/reminders/service-reminders/">automated service and renewal reminders</a>, you can receive timely emails that will alert you for due soon, due, and overdue actions. Then you can link directly to your <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">fleet software</a> and update records. Because very few things sting like a repair bill for an avoidable breakdown.</p>

<h3 id="onlineglovebox">Online Glovebox</h3>

<p>The glovebox has historically been your catch all for <a href="http://www.ehow.com/list_7300452_documents-should-keep-car_.html">insurance documentation, service receipts and driver information</a>. With online document storage, maintenance history and license details, you can clean that sucker out and use it to house useful items (gloves maybe?). This especially comes in handy if you are operating a <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration-licensing/online-registration/onlineregdescription.htm">DOT regulated vehicle</a> and must have inspection records handy in additon to these other documents. With online storage, you can access important information whenever you need it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Meet the Newest Member of Team Fleetio: Jorge Valdivia</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/11/meet-our-latest-addition-to-the-fleetio-team-jorge-valdivia</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/527d1cece4b0101a02ef884d/1383931117453/Screen%20Shot%202013-11-08%20at%2010.59.56%20AM.png.56%20AM.png?format=original" /><p>We are delighted to introduce Jorge Valdivia, our newest addition to the Fleetio team. He joins us in the role of Senior Software Engineer and is already hard at work building awesome <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleetio</a> features. We subjected Jorge to a quick Q&amp;A sesssion so you can get to know our new pal.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1: Hey Jorge, can you give us your story?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> I'm originally from Tyler, Texas, and I still live in the area. My parents are both originally from Mexico and that has a huge impact on my life. We (my parents and my two sisters) try to immerse ourselves completely in Mexican culture, while still absorbing as much American culture as possible. I try to travel to Mexico as much as I can to keep up with everything, but many people will tell you the real reason is to visit my awesome girlfriend, Perla, who is currently studying her master's degree there.</p>

<p>I have a B.S. in computer science from the University of Texas at Tyler, where I also minored in psychology. Creating great software is definitely my number one passion, but I absolutely love learning about human psychology and I try to keep it with it as much as I can. My favorite area to study is language development. Being bilingual since I can remember, I've always had a deep interest in how we perceive and learn language.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2: What are Your Hobbies and Interests?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> My main three hobbies are coding, playing the guitar (poorly), and riding my motorcycle. </p>

<p>I love coding because of the mental challenge and eventual satisfaction that comes from creating even the simplest app. This feeling is only magnified when working on larger products such as Fleetio.</p>

<p>I haven't a musical bone in my body, but playing the guitar soothes me, especially after a long day of work. I like to just sit back, relax, and strum some tunes while contemplating long day's worth of thoughts and challenges.</p>

<p>One of my newer hobbies revolves around my motorcycle. I love taking it out and riding to no destination in particular. You really get a good feeling of your surroundings, much more than a car, and it can really makes you appreciate the landscape you drive by every day, but never pay mind to. </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/527d1d05e4b033f836220977/1383931143263/Screen%20Shot%202013-11-08%20at%2010.59.28%20AM.png.28%20AM.png?format=original" /><p><strong>Question 3: What made you want to work at Fleetio?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> Two things attracted me to Fleetio: the product and the team. I've always wanted to work on a product that solves a problem and that people love to use. Once I saw what Fleetio could do, and how the customers absolutely love it, I was sold.</p>

<p>Please join us in welcoming Jorge!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That's what we are all about here at Fleetio. And as we continue to add features to our software, we find new ways to make usability even better. </p>

<p>Our most recent update, you may have noticed, involved moving the vehicle update buttons to the left side of the Vehicle Overview Screen. This allows you to update the vehicle and see the current status all in the same place.</p>

<p>Simply hover over the buttons to see what they do. You can still add a wide variety of information, change the status or assign the vehicle to a person all with a simple click.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to Get a Handle on Fleet Maintenance</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/11/how-to-get-a-handle-on-fleet-maintenance</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/527950b0e4b0d2489b3a07fc/1383682226749/Car%20Inspection%20-%20USAG-Humphries.jpg" /><p>Whether you are new to fleet management or have years of experience, it is good to go back to the basics occasionally. The fall of the year, when you are winterizing your fleet, is a great time to re-introduce yourself to the fleet.</p>

<h3 id="knowyourfleetassets">Know your Fleet Assets</h3>

<p>This is a simple check of your current records. A <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">fleet management system</a> or spreadsheet will help to organize your notes and to give you a handy reference for the physical inspection. Here is what to check:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit number, unit purchase date and vehicle identification number (VIN)</li>
<li>License number and date of annual renewal</li>
<li>The PM or Oil Change Cycle for each unit</li>
<li>Average weekly miles traveled or hours operated for each unit</li>
<li>When was the last PM or Oil Change</li>
<li>Maintenance receipts and records, including totals</li>
</ul>

<p>Once this is done, benchmark these costs against those for similar vehicles. Be sure to make note what appears to be higher than average in any category of fuel MPG, tire replacement costs per mile and general maintenance. You now have a comprehensive overview of the fleet records.</p>

<h3 id="inspecttheactualvehicles">Inspect the Actual Vehicles</h3>

<p>You have made a list of each unit in your fleet, now you need to make a visual inspection of each one. It is best to have a helper as you check the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Walk around each vehicle noting any damages, broken glass and missing parts.</li>
<li>Have a helper operate the high and low beam headlights, turn signals and brakes while you observe the actual function.  </li>
<li>License plate number and year. </li>
<li>Compare VIN number to your records.  </li>
<li>License receipt in the vehicle and compare numbers.  </li>
<li>Current insurance card in the vehicle? </li>
<li>Any required safety equipment that should be in the vehicle</li>
<li>Condition of upholstery and carpet. </li>
<li>Insure all the instruments function and the windows work </li>
<li>Seat belt condition and accessibility  </li>
<li>Current odometer (compare with your records) </li>
<li>Tires -  tread depth, air pressure, unusual wear patterns and damage.  Check lug nuts for signs of rust.  </li>
<li>Fluid leaks in the engine area</li>
<li>Wear on the drive belt </li>
<li>Fluid level and filters </li>
<li>Note any problems</li>
</ul>

<p>This process should certainly renew your personal investment in the fleet condition and ensure that you have a reference point for each vehicle going forward. With the notes you have made combined with any photos you have taken, you are ready to update your <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleetio</a> records. The important information gathered during this process will help you in making decisions about ongoing maintenance. You can now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop a schedule of PM/Oil Changes based on current information.  </li>
<li>Project future PM costs based on mileage traveled weekly per vehicle.</li>
<li>Schedule corrective and preventive repairs based on the observations.  </li>
<li>Predict tire replacements for vehicle based on known current wear. </li>
<li>Be better prepared to make repair decisions.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Getting Your Fleet Ready for Winter</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/10/getting-your-fleet-ready-for-winter</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5268274ee4b0d94adb889c1c/1382557524132/Snow%20Driving%20Frankenmedia.jpg" /><p>Unless you happen to live in a place that doesn’t experience seasonal swings in temperature (here’s looking at you San Diego) or are about to hit summer below the equator, then you might be getting your first reminder that it is getting colder. That’s what is currently happening here in the Southeastern US. Winter, whether you love it or hate it, is about to present some new challenges for your fleet.</p>

<p>Here are some tips to make sure your fleet is ready for Winter.</p>

<h3 id="tires">Tires</h3>

<p>The drop in ambient temperature is going to cause a decrease in tire pressure. Treaded <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/2/taking-care-of-your-tires">tires operating below their intended settings</a> will tend to buckle and leave less space for channeling dirt, water and snow. You want to give your drivers as much traction as possible, because they are going to need it.</p>

<h3 id="battery">Battery</h3>

<p>It can be <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/repair/4301503">harder to turn the engine over in cold weather</a> because the oil tends to thicken. This requires more power from the battery to get things going. Chemical reactions the battery uses to create power also tend to slow in colder temperatures, heightening chances for a failure. To hedge your bets, go ahead and test the battery to make sure it will hold a charge consistently. Dirty leads or loose connections can also be a hindrance, so keep an eye out for those as well.</p>

<h3 id="oil">Oil</h3>

<p>If you live in an area where below freezing days are common in the winter, it might be worth switching your vehicles to a <a href="http://www.today.com/id/15940164/#.UmfnXpRgaCg">thinner, less viscous oil</a> that will put less stress on the engine. If you are unsure of what options are available, you can check the owner’s manual or ask a service technician who is familiar with your vehicle. </p>

<h3 id="coolant">Coolant</h3>

<p>To keep the liquid in your radiator from icing, be sure that you have at least a 1-to-1 mixture of water and antifreeze. Err on the side of caution, because if the coolant stops flowing and the engine starts overheating, you could have some very expensive problems to deal with.</p>

<h3 id="wipers">Wipers</h3>

<p>Sleet and snow on your windshield are a tall order for worn out wiper blades. It’s already hard enough to drive in bad conditions, so make sure that your vehicle operators have full view of the road ahead with a fresh set of blades and a reservoir topped off with wiper fluid that can withstand freezing temperatures. </p>

<h3 id="emergencykit">Emergency Kit</h3>

<p>Throw an <a href="http://www.dmv.org/how-to-guides/winterize-car.php">Emergency kit</a> in each vehicle. If you already have one (kudos), then just be sure that there are a few cold weather extras like a blanket, gloves, etc. in the event that one of your drivers is stuck out in the elements.</p>

<p>We also suggest a big pot of chili at the end of the day...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why Backup Cameras are a No Brainer</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/10/why-backup-cameras-are-a-no-brainer</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/525f53fae4b03c6d7aadc3e4/1381979130683/Backing%20Up%20-%20Robert%20Couse-Baker.jpg" /><p>It is tough to avoid obstacles that you can’t see. This especially holds true if you are operating large commercial vehicles with gaping blind spots and limited/obstructed rear vision. Walk-around checks, strategic parking, cones, and other precautions can help in limiting backing accidents, but the safest bet is always going to be giving your drivers a full range of vision. The best way to do this is with a rearview camera.</p>

<p>Each year in the US, approximately <a href="http://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/videoresource/fsvehiclebackin.pdf">15,000 people are injured in backing incidents and 500 are killed</a>. All of these instances are completely avoidable. The key is to eliminate any guesswork and take assumptions out of popping the vehicle in reverse. Proximity alarms, which give an audible indication of objects behind you, are helpful, but they fail to paint a complete picture. Objects (or people) in motion are still very difficult to detect before it is too late.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/09/25/backup-cameras-dot-lawsuit-gulbransen-obama-administration/2870819/">Federal regulations</a> are expected to be in place by 2015 to require rearview cameras in every light-duty production vehicle, but you don’t have to wait until they are standard to give your drivers a clearer view of their surroundings. Retrofitting your existing fleet can be easier that you might think. <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/car-technology/adding-a-back-up-camera-to-your-vehicle.html">Aftermarket camera systems</a> can be purchased and installed for around $150.</p>

<p>Accidents (even minor ones) and downtime are a big hassle to your company. For the peace of mind of you and your drivers, invest a little extra money in rearview cameras and make your fleet safer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Giving Your Fleet an Aerodynamic Advantage</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/10/giving-your-fleet-an-aerodynamic-advantage</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/525428a2e4b0011c8b263a16/1381247143236/Trucking%20Concept%20cmonville.jpg" /><p>Although often overlooked, the impact of poor aerodynamics can really cost your fleet in fuel consumption. In high mileage applications, the difference can even be quite noticeable. With some basic principles, we are going to cover a few very achievable improvements that you can make and see real savings for your company.</p>

<h3 id="myexperienceinaerodynamics">My Experience in Aerodynamics</h3>

<p>Much of my free time at Auburn University was devoted to designing, building and racing an <a href="http://wp.auburn.edu/soa/">experimental solar-powered vehicle</a>. While many social activities were sacrificed, this pursuit did have some interesting perks - like playing with really expensive materials and equipment.</p>

<p>One of the more noteworthy examples of this privilege came toward the end of our design phase with the Solar Car. Utilizing CAD renderings and a 3-D printer (extremely rare in 2004), we had different scale models of the car produced. And then, we got to play in Auburn’s subsonic wind tunnel. Now “play” probably does a disservice to the painstaking hours of precise setup and measurement, but who gets to do that kind of stuff?</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5254285ce4b0e53491ebaeda/1381247070096/Auburn%20Solar%20Car.jpg" /><p>More lasting than the time we spent testing the models were the lessons learned. As with any classroom topic, the principles of aerodynamics resonated much heavier when I could see the real world results of vehicle design. </p>

<p>For our car, every percent gain in efficiency was huge. Winning and losing was in the balance with every little advantage. But, when you think about it, such small wins across an entire fleet of vehicles can pay off in a similar fashion. The more mileage your drivers are racking up, the more important such fuel economy gains can be to your bottom line. You probably aren’t headed to a wind tunnel anytime soon to make improvements, but we have some tips and ideas that can certainly help you see a difference over time.</p>

<h3 id="improvingaerodynamicefficiency">Improving Aerodynamic Efficiency</h3>

<h4 id="speedingcostsyou">Speeding Costs You</h4><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5254293ce4b055e5383a6dcd/1381247292527/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-07%20at%207.54.32%20PM.png.32%20PM.png?format=original" /><p>Your last math class may have been a long time ago, but you don’t have to be a scholar to understand this principle. As you go faster, the drag (wind resistance) that slows down a vehicle increases exponentially (velocity squared). Basically, that means that the force resisting a car in motion doesn’t just go up incrementally with each mph, it slopes steeply upward toward costing you gas money. Getting your drivers to slow down is not only safer, it is also the easiest way to cut down on fuel costs.</p>

<h4 id="therightprofiletomatchtheload">The Right Profile to Match the Load</h4>

<p>Part of rightsizing a fleet is making strategic vehicle purchases based on the job they will perform. Whether you require custom-made bodies or have a variety of trailer options, it is important to consider that you want the lowest front profile as possible. Over a long haul, an unnecessarily large, boxy vehicle is going to burn through much more fuel than one which closely accommodates your loads.</p>

<h4 id="aeroenhancements">Aero Enhancements</h4>

<p>For those in the trucking industry, aerodynamic devices have been a hot topic in the last few years of high fuel prices. The challenge, as with many fleet decisions, is equating promised gains with actual realization. As mentioned previously, companies with high mileage, over-the-road operations are the best fit for achieving savings over time.</p>

<p>You can already see the widespread advancement of aerodynamics by major manufacturers. New models by <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/1/fleets-vehicles-are-changing-2014-models-and-beyond">Ford</a>, <a href="http://www.autoweek.com/article/20131008/CARNEWS/131009846">GM</a>, and <a href="http://www.thetrucker.com/News/Stories/2013/10/2/Volvoupsantewith2014fuel-savingengines.aspx">Volvo</a> are sporting thoughtfully designed features like front grill shutters, streamlined mirror covers and enhanced ground effects. </p>

<p>For tractor trailers, there are a number of add-ons that can make the rig slicker going down the road. These include side skirts, rear covers and fairings - all having the objective of keeping the air flow as laminar (non-turbulent) as possible. You will see a lot of focus on decreasing wheel exposure, as spinning air surrounding them creates a profile much larger frontal area than the tire size implies.</p>

<p>Depending on the product, <a href="http://www.todaystrucking.com/pit-reveals-aero-testing-results">a savings of 5-7% in fuel consumption can be realized</a>. Up front expenses vary, but if you have mileage logged in a <a href="http://fleetio.com">fleet management system</a>, then you can easily determine the payback period. With current gas and diesel prices being where they are, it is at least worth a quick look to see if your vehicles could benefit from this investment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>What Average Fuel Economy Should You Expect?</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/10/what-average-fuel-economy-should-you-expect</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/524b331be4b0c53427bf6e4f/1380660001753/Fuel%20Economy%20Dash%20Robert%20Couse-Baker.jpg" /><p>EPA fuel economy ratings are getting a bad rap these days. Manufacturer promises are falling short. Even the fuel economy as reported by your own vehicle has proven to be <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/In-Gear/2013/0928/Fuel-economy-Why-your-car-s-gauge-is-probably-wrong">about five percent too optimistic on average</a>. So how can you find out the actual miles per gallon numbers for your car or truck? </p>

<p>It is hard to make educated decisions with bad information. If you merely have window stickers and exaggerated estimates to go off of, then how can you really prove that your fleet is saving the money that you think it should? With the <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/50014208">price of new vehicles steadily climbing </a> it is important that you justify a purchase with the payback from better fuel mileage. Here are some suggestions that will help you sort through the fluff and find real, actionable data.</p>

<p>Odometer readings and some quick math can help you find the truth. Incorporating fuel cards (with required mileage entry) and a <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">fleet management system</a> that integrates with that data can help streamline the process. When purchases are imported into your software, MPG calculations and cost/mile updates should happen automatically. Just be sure to emphasize to your vehicle operators that the odometer reading should be accurate at the time of fill-up.</p>

<p>There are also a number of online resources that have more realistic mpg ratings listed. Crowdsourced figures like <a href="http://www.fuelly.com/car/">these</a> are going to be much more usable when benchmarking your fleet’s performance numbers. <a href="http://edmunds.com">Edmunds.com</a>, along with several other mainstream automotive sites, will regularly post road tests with accurate fuel economy numbers, so feel free to do a quick search. If your company tends to purchase many of the same make/model, then use your fleet software and historical data to target underperforming vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Reading:</strong></p>

<p>If you have the time, Car and Driver put together an extensive article on <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/features/the-truth-about-epa-city-highway-mpg-estimates">how the EPA estimates fuel economy</a>. You can quickly see how your fleet could be reporting averages that are way off of their estimates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New Study Looks at Diesel vs Electric for Fleet Vehicles</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/9/new-study-looks-at-diesel-vs-electric-for-fleet-vehicles</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5245f00fe4b05bfd3a95cc1c/1380315154628/Tesla%20Oregon%20DOT.jpg" /><p>A new study out of the <a href="http://www.gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/diesel-or-electric-study/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> pits diesel versus electric vehicles against each other to find out which is the better option for fleet vehicle owners in suburban and urban areas. Researchers found that, like many complicated things of this nature, it really all depends on where you're driving and what you're doing.</p>

<p>For example, it was determined that "electric urban delivery trucks use about 30 percent less total energy and emit about 40 percent less greenhouse gases than diesel trucks, for about the same total cost." In other words, electric trucks appear to come out on top right? Yes, in an urban setting, especially with a lot of stop-and-go traffic and driving, electric seems to be the way to go. It was found that they are 50 percent more efficient and therefore 20 percent cheaper to run.</p>

<p>However, when you bring those same trucks to a suburban setting, that's when things turn the way of the diesel truck. You see, Georgia Tech points to the fact that electric vehicles rely on stop-and-go driving to allow for the regenerative power feature during braking. That all but disappears when the routes are longer and the speed limits are increased. And that is where diesel becomes the more efficient mode of transportation.</p>

<p>Recently featured <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/9/saving-with-smarter-fuel-management">here on The Fleetio Blog</a> are some great tips on how to save more money through smarter fuel management. One additional way to do that is to download an app; many of which are available for free on <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/device/smartphone/iphone">Verizon Wireless' newly released iPhone</a>. It's just another way that you can better monitor the expenses of your drivers while also keeping up with the maintenance of your fleet, be it electric or diesel.</p>

<p>In other words: When it comes to cost, it all depends. The same goes for emissions, which can rise or fall based on how the electricity is created in your state. If you're charging your electric vehicle in a state where coal is used, the overall emissions rate is higher. Even so, the study states that electric trucks were able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least a third when compared to their diesel counterparts.</p>

<p>Equally up in the air is how electric vehicle technology will improve in the future. Is it worth it to invest in a fleet of these trucks if they're going to be obsolete or a cheaper option is available? According to one professor in the study, "Battery price reductions down the road could have a large effect on the cost-competitiveness of electric trucks, while only diesel fuel prices could have a similarly large effect on the future cost-competitiveness of diesel trucks."</p>

<p>What this all teaches us is that it's very important to keep up with both latest trends for electric trucks—should that be something you wish to pursue—while gauging the range of your business. It's undeniable that electric is the way to go in the city, so it could be worth mix and matching should you expand your business.</p>

      <title>Saving With Smarter Fuel Management</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/9/saving-with-smarter-fuel-management</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5242efdfe4b06a4d07bf5709/1380118499378/Fuel%20Prices.jpg" /><p>Fuel is more than likely the biggest monthly expense for your fleet. And when not managed carefully, this line item in the budget can really eat into the success of a company. How can you keep fuel in check without burying yourself knee deep in spreadsheets and receipts? Let us show you how with these simple keys to success:</p>

<h3 id="setclearexpectationsforyourdrivers">Set Clear Expectations for Your Drivers</h3>

<p>Before we get to some of the controls that you can implement at your company, it is worth emphasizing that the foundation of a well-run fleet is a standard of expectation. If your drivers have nothing to base their performance on and no goals to target, then your fuel expenses are at their complete discretion. With fuel costs making up so much of your vehicle-related expenses, you would be remiss in not placing a high priority on responsible fuel management. Benchmark fuel economy/use numbers and let your drivers know what is expected of them.</p>

<h3 id="monitorexpensesinafleetmanagementsystem">Monitor Expenses in a Fleet Management System</h3>

<p>Surprise, a <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">fleet management software company</a> suggests that you use such a product. As we have discussed before, it is a bad idea to set goals and expectations without any way to monitor progress. A fleet management system, especially one that is easy to access and use, is your best bet for tracking fuel and all other expenses. Instead of sorting through receipts and spreadsheets, you can let an intelligent software link up with <a href="http://fleetio.com/fuel-cards">fuel cards</a> and calculate MPG and Cost/Mile automatically. Reporting is much easier as well.</p>

<h3 id="utilizefuelcards">Utilize Fuel Cards</h3>

<p>Why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_card">fuel cards</a>? Unlike purchasing cards or allowing personal expensing, these are specifically focused on fleet-related expenses. You can restrict use to the pump, the convenience store, or a maintenance shop. There is also built-in logic to capture driver information and mileage when filling up, which is essential to calculating performance. The more information that you have the better, both in terms of reporting and preventing theft. Fuel cards also usually provide savings on bulk purchasing, so you could actually pay less per gallon than the advertised price. That can really add up over a large fleet.</p>

<h3 id="regulatevehicleuse">Regulate Vehicle Use</h3>

<p>We have talked with some of our customers about the struggles of managing where and when their vehicles are used. Some allow employees to take their company car or truck home on the weekends, but monitoring this is tricky. You may have to implement GPS tracking, if you haven’t already, to ensure that vehicles are only being used for appropriate purposes during the workday. You can setup alerts to notify you accordingly.</p>

<p>Miles that don’t help your business could killing your bottom line. This might be a perk of working at your company, but even when denoted as personal miles, the cost combined with the wear and tear on your vehicles could have you considering other perks instead. Either way, setting standards and monitoring usage is must.</p>

<h3 id="lookatalternativefuels">Look at Alternative Fuels</h3>

<p>On the Fleetio Blog, we have discussed <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/5-steps-to-a-green-fleet">alternative fuels</a> on several occasions. Switching to <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/5/the-growth-of-cng-fleets-by-the-numbers">natural gas</a>, diesel, or electric vehicles (EVs) certainly is not viable for everyone, but depending on your location and regional legislation there could be potential in considering other options. As we have seen, industries and companies with more predictable routes (municipal, waste management, local delivery, etc.) are well suited for alternative fuels, but adoption has certainly spread beyond this group. Either way, it is worth a look.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Plugging Into Your Fleet Data</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/9/plugging-into-your-fleet-data</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/523ca669e4b0918ead35e7ce/1379706476149/Dashboard.jpg" /><p>The modern vehicle is a very complex piece of machinery. Mechanically speaking, there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_dynamics">a lot going on when you are rolling down the road</a>. And in the last few decades, added electrical systems have made the car even more complicated. Data, thousands of bits of information per second, is being generated, analyzed and stored while your vehicle is in operation. But what good is that to you?</p>

<p>Outside of the steering wheel and heads up display, you may not feel very connected to your vehicle. There are, however, ways to tap into its brain and make sure everything is hunky dory, because we all know the <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/6/your-check-engine-light-is-on-what-to-do">check engine light is an ambiguous nightmare</a>. For fleet managers, this is even more important. Finding “Trouble Codes” before they become a serious problem might seem like a big task with many vehicles, but we’ll talk about ways for you to keep an eye on your fleet with automated reporting for this data. </p>

<p>The most notable information coming from your vehicles, as far as fleet maintenance is concerned, pertains to the <a href="http://www.dmv.de.gov/services/Vehicle_Services/dtc_list.pdf">Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs)</a>. These are going to tell you if there is a car or truck experiencing any system irregularities. The list of possibilities can be quite extensive, but there are <a href="http://www.obd-codes.com/trouble_codes/">resources available online to look up what the DTC means</a>. For most light duty vehicles, your window to this information is a universal OBD-II port that sits just below the steering column. </p>

<p>So how do you detect the DTC instances across an entire fleet? Do you have to walk around to each vehicle, plugging in a reader to each OBD-II port? Thankfully, no. There are onboard devices that can capture data and alert you remotely when problems occur. This could be via an active tracking device like GPS or a passive (non-location-based) <a href="http://fleetio.com/vhm">vehicle health monitor (VHM)</a>. The latter will typically be less expensive, as it does not require a constant network connection to transmit data.</p>

<p>In order to process these codes coming from a telematics device, it helps to have <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">fleet management software</a> that can link directly to the hardware. Alerts and interactive reporting can let you know if there is anything that needs attention across the fleet. Then you can use maintenance scheduling functionality to make sure your driver takes in a problem vehicle for timely service.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Taking a Proactive Approach to Fleet Management with Fleetio</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/9/taking-a-proactive-approach-to-fleet-management-with-fleetio</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5238aa69e4b0ebf09beaed0b/1379445359868/Servpro%20of%20Birmingham%20Fleet.jpg" /><p><a href="http://www.servprobirminghamsouth.com/">Servpro of Birmingham</a> provides restoration, cleaning and remediation services around the clock for commercial and residential customers in the Birmingham, Alabama area. The franchise, started in 1982, employs around 100 and is co-owned by David, Christie, Benji and Brady Wilson. The revenue generated from their two Birmingham locations is over $9 million annually. </p>

<p>Brady Wilson, who has worked at Servpro of Birmingham since he was 15, handles the day-to-day operations of the company, overseeing around 80 direct reports and a fleet of 72 vehicles. Having a technical background, Brady is passionate about finding modern tools that can improve the overall efficiency of both his franchise and Servpro locations around the country. Software and mobile devices help his team handle a variety of daily tasks and ensure everyone is on the same page.</p>

<p>Fleet management is an area where, in December of 2012, Brady saw the need for improvement. After experiencing engine failures in 5 of his vehicles and paying thousands in unnecessary repairs, Wilson requested the most recent oil change records for the entire fleet. He found that their system for <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-maintenance-software'">tracking vehicle and maintenance information</a> was fragmented. It was time to find a solution.</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5238aafde4b0cb4c81676010/1379445502998/Servpro%20of%20Birmingham%20Staff.jpg" /><p>“When I came across <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleetio</a>, I knew it was exactly what I was looking for,” explains Wilson. “Many of our employees have iPads, so I was looking for a web-based solution that was easy to access and navigate. The email reminders also really help with accountability.” Brady and his team use the notifications from Fleetio to effectively communicate tasks on a daily basis. By including management, drivers and assistants on each reminder, they ensure that nothing slips through the cracks.</p>

<p>Since becoming a customer, Servpro of Birmingham has helped in testing several Fleetio features. They have provided valuable feedback on our <a href="http://fleetio.com/fuel-cards">fuel card integration</a>, <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/9/introducing-people-management">People Module</a>,  and Fleetio mobile. Brady, an admitted fan of Web 2.0 software and Google Apps, likes that he can send us suggestions for how we can make Fleetio better. “The Fleetio staff has been very responsive and in tune with the needs of our company,” adds Wilson. </p>

<p>With over thirty users on the Servpro of Birmingham Fleetio account, their staff is constantly adding data, documents, photos and more. This information helps them to make better decisions about which vehicles to purchase and also keeps their heavy duty vehicles in compliance, as 30% of the fleet is DOT regulated.</p>

<p>We are delighted to have <a href="http://www.facebook.com/servprobham">Servpro of Birmingham</a> and thousands of other fleets around the world using Fleetio.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Having a technical background, Brady is passionate about finding modern tools that can improve the overall efficiency of both his franchise and Servpro locations around the country. Software and mobile devices help his team handle a variety of daily tasks and ensure everyone is on the same page.</p><p>Fleet management is an area where, in December of 2012, Brady saw the need for improvement. After experiencing engine failures in 5 of his vehicles and paying thousands in unnecessary repairs, Wilson requested the most recent oil change records for the entire fleet. He found that their system for [tracking vehicle and maintenance information was fragmented. It was time to find a solution.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Introducing People Management</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/9/introducing-people-management</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managing fleet vehicles is important to successful fleet operations, but managing the people that operate those vehicles is just as important.</p>

<p>Fleetio exists to be a home for everything that is important to your fleet. And people certainly fall into that category. </p>

<p>We're thrilled to introduce the new "People" module in Fleetio.</p>

<p>Drivers and other people are essential to daily fleet operations. Fleetio's new People profiles, vehicle-to-driver assignments and associated reporting tools are designed to ensure that you know who is operating which vehicle and when.</p>

      <title>7 Habits of Highly Effective Fleet Managers</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/9/7-habits-of-highly-effective-fleet-managers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52308a46e4b0f0d96ed80a28/1378912839393/Mini%20Truck%20Fleet%20Michael%20Cote.jpg" /><p>There are a number of habits that can make for highly effective fleet managers. These best practices, when applied appropriately, can really make a difference in your company’s bottom line and the overall safety of your workforce. Taking lessons from <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleetio</a> customers around the world and <a href="http://www.nafa.org/conference/2013-awards/">notable fleet professionals</a>, we have compiled a list of basic principles that are pretty much guaranteed to improve the management of your vehicles. A nod to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/0743269519">Steven R. Covey</a> for the title.</p>

<p>So here it goes, in no particular order...</p>

<h4 id="beproactiveinsteadofreactivewhenitcomestosafety">Be Proactive Instead of Reactive When it Comes to Safety</h4>

<p>With the numerous distractions and safety hazards for your drivers, it is always a good idea to get out ahead of any potential problems. If you wait until an accident or near miss, then your company and employees could pay dearly. The cost of a hands-free device, <a href="http://www.automotive-fleet.com/channel/safety-accident-management/article/story/2011/08/6-mobile-applications-to-prevent-distracted-driving-accidents.aspx?prestitial=1">cell phone disabler</a> or <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/4/fleetio-flicks-fleet-safety-and-black-boxes-with-gary-johnson">in-cab cameras</a> may seem like overkill, but the alternative is always going to be more expensive.</p>

<h4 id="makemaintenancemanagementeasy">Make Maintenance Management Easy</h4>

<p>People are inherently lazy, and unless you employ self-driving vehicles (link), then you are going to be battling this tendency. If you want your drivers to take their vehicles in for routine service and maintenance, you need to make scheduling and reporting as effortless as possible. We’ve seen whiteboards, hand written notes, and file folders used to keep fleets on schedule. Online <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">fleet management software</a>, automated email reminders and mobile accessibility are the key to a successful vehicle maintenance program.</p>

<h4 id="setguidelinesforvehiclepurchasinganddisposal">Set Guidelines for Vehicle Purchasing and Disposal</h4>

<p>Every couple of weeks, you hear about a government entity that is being reviewed for <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/25/hundreds-of-5-year-old-municipal-vehicles-found-in-miami-that-we/">improper management of their vehicles</a>. The size of these operations and public scrutiny usually bring to light a number of common problems; namely the lack of a uniform purchasing and disposal program. When you have no consistent guidelines, different managers, departments and locations will take it upon themselves to buy vehicles as needed and keep for as long as they see fit. Without bulk purchasing and insight into the right time/mileage for selling vehicles, your company could be hemorrhaging money. Consistency is key, so take the time to spec out vehicle options, put a plan in place and rightsize for the requirements of your fleet.</p>

<h4 id="setgoalsandexpectationsfordriverperformance">Set Goals and Expectations for Driver Performance</h4>

<p>We have some customers who incentivize drivers for doing a good job - whether this be fuel efficient operation or regularly performing vehicle inspections. While this may not work for everyone, you should always hold your drivers to a performance standard.  The potential fuel savings for better driving habits and a well running vehicle can really add up across an entire fleet.</p>

<h4 id="measureeverymetricthatmatters">Measure Every Metric that Matters</h4>

<p>In order to be on top of your fleet operations, you need the right data. After all, how can you improve upon something when you don’t know the starting point? Since it incorporates many important elements, cost per mile is one metric that should be on everyone’s list.</p>

<h4 id="documenteverythingimportant">Document Everything Important</h4>

<p>In today’s world, where online storage is cheap, there are no excuses for not knowing where you fleet information is. Invoices, work orders, receipts, photos, employee records, product manuals and more can be kept in one central location and accessed from any internet-connected device. If you are still using file folders, then it is time for an upgrade.</p>

<h4 id="stayuptodateonadvancesintheindustry">Stay up to Date on Advances in the Industry</h4>

<p>Join an <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/6/join-a-fleet-management-association">industry association</a>, read trade publications and keep up with what is happening in vehicle technology. Our team has seen Fleetio users make a big difference in their operations with the adoption of new technology and best practices. Alternative fuels, once seen as a long shot, may actually be within reach and cost-effective for your fleet. The same goes for vehicle technology, where, if you have accurate data (#5) for your vehicles, you can make educated decisions about payback on investments.</p>

      <title>Finding Vehicle Recalls for Your Fleet</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/9/finding-vehicle-recalls-for-your-fleet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5229d0c2e4b0abcfdb47ba7c/1378472132788/Engine%20Close%20Up%20-%20Sylvar.jpg" /><p>For the safety and bottom line of your fleet, one of your jobs as a Fleet Manager is to keep up with the applicable recalls issued for your vehicles. Catching these notifications and getting vehicles scheduled for service may be a hassle, but the money and frustration that you could save from doing otherwise is well worth it. If you are proactive about reporting issues that come up within your fleet, you could also help initiate a manufacturer recall. Below are our tips to make this whole process digestible and easy to manage.</p>

<p>Most recalls are voluntary by the manufacturer, and the owner of the vehicles is supposed to be properly notified if one is issued. It is best, however, to make sure you have all of your bases covered and keep on the lookout yourself. Also, keep in mind that the statute of limitations for a no-charge recall is 8 years from the original sale date of the vehicle. After that, you may be on your own to pay for fixes. To make sure that you catch them in time,  here are a number of great resources that can help. </p>

<h3 id="recallsearches">Recall searches</h3>

<p>First off, you can sign up to receive automatic notifications at <a href="http://recall.gov">Recall.gov</a>. They also have a mobile aff if that makes it easier for you. If you prefer a non-government-looking interface, <a href="http://www.progressive.com/vehicle-resources/vehicle-recall-search/">Progressive Insurance</a> has a recall search as well. </p>

<h3 id="filingacomplaintwithnhtsa">Filing a complaint with NHTSA</h3>

<p>NHTSA gathers information on their site that they use to initiate recalls. If you experience a vehicle defect (especially a systematic one) within your fleet, it may be a good idea to report it <a href="https://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ivoq/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="otherresources">Other resources</h3>

<p>Here at Fleetio, we are always looking for ways to provide our users and blog readers with timely information that might be relevant to their fleets. One of our most reliable sources for recall and safety information is <a href="http://www.vehicleservicepros.com/">VehicleServicePros.com</a>. Their site and newsletter regularly highlight major recalls that might be pertinent to your vehicles. <a href="http://recall.carfax.com/">Carfax</a> also has a recall-specific check you can run that is free of charge - just have your vehicle identification number (VIN) on hand.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Employee Documentation for a Commercial Fleet</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/9/employee-documentation-for-a-commercial-fleet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52261b73e4b086aa1b843509/1378229108306/OregonDOT.jpg" /><p>As a Fleet Manager, keeping up with your vehicles is only part of the battle. In addition to maintenance schedules, record keeping and expense tracking, you have to manage the people that interact with your Fleet. You need to know who is driving each vehicle, whether their certifications or licenses up to date, and ensure that everyone has the appropriate documentation. Does your head hurt just thinking about this? Don’t worry, with the right tools and procedures, it can all be manageable. </p>

<p>For this article, we are going to focus specifically on what you need to be cognizant of if you are managing a fleet with CDL (Commercial Drivers License) requirements. The regulations can vary from state to state, but here are the essentials of what you need to know.</p>

<h3 id="documentationineachvehicle">Documentation in Each Vehicle</h3>

<p>For every fleet vehicle, there must be tag/title information and Insurance documentation on hand, regardless of who is driving. If you have a pool of vehicles, then it is best to keep this information in a common location so it will be easy to find. Of course each driver operating a commercial vehicle (with a gross vehicle weight of 26,001 lbs or more) is going to need to have their CDL on hand and it must be up to date. It helps to store a copy of the license, along with the renewal date in a <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">fleet management system</a>. This way, you can set automated reminders and keep drivers up to date on their certifications.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.truckingoffice.com/category/dot-rules-and-regulations">Pre and post-trip inspection records</a> are also required for every vehicle in this classification. You must have these documented in writing. With an <a href="http://fleetio.com/">online software program</a>, it is easy to log these records and access them as needed, whether you are at the office or on the road.</p>

<h3 id="whattokeepinyourplaceofbusiness">What to Keep in Your Place of Business</h3>

<p>There are a number of requirements for what you must keep at your place of business if there are CDL operated vehicles in your fleet. If called upon by DOT inspectors, you can be asked to present these materials at any time. </p>

<h4 id="fcmsarules">FCMSA Rules</h4>

<p>First off, you must have the most current copy of the <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association (FMCSA)</a> in your office. You also must have your drivers sign and date that they have received the rules and also agree to comply with them. </p>

<h4 id="maintenanceprogram">Maintenance Program</h4>

<p>As a Fleet Manager, you will also have to prove that your company has a regular maintenance program in place and that it is followed appropriately. The key here is to automate as much of this program as possible. Setting recurring reminders that email your employees is the best way to stay compliant. Several products allow you to set a “threshold” for when a notification arrives, so be sure to take advantage of that feature and put service activities on the schedule before they are due. A fleet management software will allow you to easily prove that there is a schedule and that it has been followed in a timely fashion.</p>

<h4 id="incidentrecords">Incident Records</h4>

<p>If a vehicle in your fleet is involved in an incident, it is imperative that you thoroughly document all important details and keep for your records. Photos, accident reports, parties involved and any documented legal proceedings are all great to have on hand. You can <a href="http://fleetio.com/cloud">store this information online</a>, so it is accessible at any time, and also have hard copies in the office.</p>

<h4 id="employeeinformation">Employee Information</h4>

<p>Up to date records regarding driver certifications, qualifications and performance history must be kept at all times. Your company is liable for the actions of your employees, so you can be held accountable if a non-compliant driver is operating a vehicle. Rather than digging for this information whenever needed, make it simply by keeping everything in one easy to access location. Web-based file storage is a great solution for this.</p>

<h4 id="drugandalcoholtestingrecords">Drug and Alcohol Testing Records</h4>

<p>There are a variety of regulations that specifically target drug and alcohol testing for your fleet. In addition to pre-employment screening, you are required to <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/safety-initiatives/drugs/engtesting.htm">randomly test at least 10% of your drivers each year for alcohol abuse and 50% for drugs</a>. If a driver is involved in an accident, they are to be tested within 8 hours if requested. Needless to say, this can be a complicated system to implement and keep up with, especially if you have a large fleet. You can outsource the responsibility to a third party drug/alcohol testing agency and have them supply you with the appropriate records. It is still probably a good idea to have a planned out schedule and ensure that all of your records are saved somewhere convenient.</p>

<p>In the next article on managing employee records, we will touch on responsibilities as they relate to trucking and over-the-road companies.</p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a Fleet Manager, keeping up with your vehicles is only part of the battle. In addition to maintenance schedules, record keeping and expense tracking, you have to manage the people that interact with your Fleet. You need to know who is driving each vehicle, whether their certifications or licenses up to date, and ensure that everyone has the appropriate documentation. Does your head hurt just thinking about this? Don’t worry, with the right tools and procedures, it can all be manageable.</p><p></p><p>For this article, we are going to focus specifically on what you need to be cognizant of if you are managing a fleet with CDL (Commercial Drivers License) requirements. The regulations can vary from state to state, but here are the essentials of what you need to know.</p><p><br></p><p></p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Alignment Tips to Save Your Fleet Time and Money</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/8/alignment-tips-to-save-your-fleet-time-and-money</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/52151a5ae4b093ac18932c7d/1377114714980/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-21%20at%201.27.16%20PM.png.16%20PM.png?format=original" /><p>On the Fleetio Blog, we have talked before about the various <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/signs-that-you-need-alignment">signs that your vehicle (or fleet of vehicles) needs realignment</a>. The list of indicators provided by Tess Winningham highlighted how you can quickly detect an issue with the way your wheels/tires are set up. Today, we would like to take things a step further and show you some handy resources that can assist in finding the proper diagnosis for misalignment and even some do-it-yourself tips for those of you who are more adventurous. The end goal is to help save your fleet from unexpected downtime as well as <a href="http://www.ehow.com/info_12142443_bad-alignment-affect-mpg.html">higher fuel and tire expenses</a>.</p>

<h4 id="alignmenttools">Alignment Tools</h4>

<p>There are a number tools available for checking the alignment of your car or truck. Whether you are a seasoned mechanic or just want to be able to easily diagnose problems at home, there is a product out there to suit your needs and budget. Be sure to check your wheel type first, because there are a few methods that can be used to attach an alignment tool to your wheels. Some use magnets, others attach to the lip of the wheel and have screw adjustment. These are going to run you <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/Alignment-Simple-Solutions">$60-300</a>, depending on the type of vehicle, wheels, and measurements (<a href="http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=4">toe, caster, camber</a>). With it only taking a few minutes to set up, regular use of this type of tool is a no brainer, just like checking your tire pressures.</p><iframe data-image-dimensions="854x480" allowfullscreen="" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/C5aItwp5w0s?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="854" data-embed="true" frameborder="0" height="480"></iframe><h4 id="findingyourspecs">Finding Your Specs</h4>

<p>Of course once you can validate the current alignment settings of your vehicle, it is important to know what the recommended manufacturer standard is. You can check your owners manual, Google the year, make, model, and “alignment specs” or download <a href="http://www.quicktrickalignment.com/shop/quicktrick-classic/web-version-quickspecs-wheel-alignment-specs-new/">a handy reference guide</a> if you manage a fleet of different vehicles. </p>

<h4 id="makingtheadjustments">Making the Adjustments</h4>

<p>For most of you, taking measurements and checking them against your specs will be the last step before either taking the vehicle in to see a trained mechanic or leaving your vehicle as-is (if the measurements are correct or close). But for those who wish to proceed with making the appropriate changes, here are some detailed <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/features/get-in-line-do-it-yourself-wheel-alignment">instructions from Car and Driver Magazine</a> on how to do your own wheel alignment.</p>

<p>If you are savvy enough to consider further factors (additional loading, operational environment, etc.) you can fine tune adjustments to your own additional specifications, just like the guys in NASCAR. We would, however, suggest that you only leave this to the pros.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Fleet Safety: Keeping Drivers Focused on the Road</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/8/fleet-safety-keeping-drivers-focused-on-the-road</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/520d1bdbe4b07b02dc60bacd/1376590812316/Cell%20Phone%20Driving%20-%20Jason%20Lander.jpg" /><p>I was on my way back from lunch today and sitting at a red light when I heard brakes screeching to my left. In an instant, a car had skidded past a red light and slammed into a vehicle who was crossing through the intersection. Clearly, the driver at fault had completely missed the light turning and failed to notice everyone stopping around them. Why? Chances are, the cell phone she was holding up to her head probably had something to do with it.</p>

<p>Mobile devices have quickly become a focal point in our daily lives. They are undoubtedly an essential tool for your business and help your operations stay connected. But where do you draw the line regarding usage while driving? </p>

<p>Some cities and states have made it illegal to text while driving or use a phone without a handsfree device. Even if your drivers aren’t breaking the law in your part of the world, should you have a policy that restricts what they can do behind the wheel? We have talked before about how vehicles, drivers, and proper maintenance can <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/branding-on-wheels-take-pride-in-your-fleet">affect your company brand</a>. What does it say if a customer (or potential customer) sees one of your drivers staring at a phone or holding one up to his/her ear while navigating traffic?</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea of how impaired using a cell phone while driving can make you, here is <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/cell-phone-and-driving.htm">an experiment by the Mythbusters</a> that might be a bit eye opening. Using two different test subjects, they were able to prove that talking on the phone impairs a driver as much or more than driving drunk. Simply put, it is difficult to concentrate at two things at the same time, especially when one of them is very sensory-heavy.</p>

<p>Hands free systems, which now integrate with many vehicles, are seen as a safer alternative. Obviously, having an extra hand for vehicle operation is an improvement, but <a href="http://www.safetynewsalert.com/cell-phones-no-safer-in-hands-free-mode-while-driving-new-in-depth-analysis/">several studies</a> still argue that the cognitive distraction still very much lessens driver awareness. Similarly, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/12/science/la-sci-sn-hands-free-phone-driving-aaa-20130612">AAA President Robert L. Darbelnet released a statement</a> back in June warning that the proliferation of hands-free systems that allow for texting, tweeting and app use while driving could lead to a hightened safety concern.</p>

<p>If you own or operate a fleet, you already know that accidents are a big liability to your organization. The money, downtime, and potential harm to your employees that a wreck can cost affects more than just your bottom line. At the same time, however, you need to be able to communicate effectively with your team throughout the day. So how do you find the happy medium between connectivity and driver safety? </p>

<p>First off, it would be wise to have a <a href="http://www.truckinginfo.com/channel/safety-compliance/article/story/2010/11/studies-show-strict-fleet-cell-phone-policies-more-effective-than-state-cell-phone-laws.aspx?prestitial=1">cell phone usage policy for your fleet</a>. If you have an understanding of when and when it is not appropriate for an employee to be using their mobile device, you have a better chance at cracking down on bad behavior.
If you want to absolutely prevent them from texting or talking on the phone while driving, then there are <a href="http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2012/07/cell-phone-jammer-blocks-driver-not-passengers.html">jammers available</a> or you can cross reference GPS/Tracking data and their cell phone record. If your employees must make a call or send a text from the road, encourage them to only do this while the vehicle is parked and they are not endangering anyone around them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Importance of Maintaining Your Brakes</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/8/the-importance-of-maintaining-your-brakes</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5203f1cae4b02ca31aeb13d4/1375990222200/Brake%20Maintenance.jpg" /><p>We tend to take our brakes for granted. The light changes, or a car slows ahead, you press the pedal, and it just works - time after time. But the sheer physics of this process are pretty eye opening. Many different components work in sync to get to keep you safe. In this article, we are going to explore not only how your brakes operate, but also how to keep them well maintained for the life of your vehicle. </p>

<p>Most fleets will have <a href="http://www.carbibles.com/brake_bible.html">disc brakes</a> on all vehicles, so we will focus on that type of system. Here’s the gist: Your foot moves a lever that displaces an incompressible fluid and causes calipers (mechanical pinchers) to squeeze a disk (rotor) that is attached to your wheels and stop the motion by way of friction and heat. The intermediary between the caliper and rotor are the brake pads, which are made of an abrasive material and designed to take the majority of the wear. </p>

<h4 id="overuse">Overuse</h4>

<p>We have talked before about <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/7/simple-tips-for-effective-eco-driving">eco driving</a> and how your brake usage can play a large part in operating efficiency. Having a heavy foot, however, can also drastically decrease the life of your equipment - putting too much heat into the pads and rotors. If this heat does not have time to dissipate properly (read: repetitive heavy braking), then you can warp the rotors and be reminded of your indiscretions at every stop light.</p>

<h4 id="detectingproblems">Detecting Problems</h4>

<p>For many brake issues, your first indicator is through driver feel. If you notice a vibration, that it takes more force to stop the vehicle, or hear a high pitched noise when slowing, then it is time to put a <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-maintenance-software">service checkup on your schedule</a>. Pads, as mentioned earlier, are usually the first in the system to fail, and are designed to make it quite noticeable (hence the screeching sound) when it happens. Just stay cognizant of how your car is responding on deceleration and you’ll notice when something is wrong.</p>

<h4 id="considertheload">Consider the Load</h4>

<p>Larger vehicles, especially those designed for towing, may have multiple or redundant braking systems. A common mistake, and extreme safety hazard, is to assume that even if one of these systems is inoperable, the rest will be able to accommodate the load. As we have heard from <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/4/fleetio-flicks-fleet-safety-and-black-boxes-with-gary-johnson">Accident Specialist Gary Johnson</a> , vehicles are designed to factory-recommended specifications and tolerances. If you are only using half of the available brakes, then you are putting way more force on your equipment than was designed. As with a passenger car, overuse can eventually lead to fade or complete failure.</p>

<h4 id="maintenanceintervals">Maintenance Intervals</h4>

<p>Keeping to the <a href="http://www.carsdirect.com/car-maintenance/brake-maintenance-basics">suggested schedule</a> in your owner’s manual and utilizing a <a href="http://fleetio.com">vehicle maintenance app</a> should keep you from missing important brake service. Not sure when to replace your parts? A good rule of thumb is to visually inspect your brake pads for wear every 12,000 miles or so. Most manufacturers will recommend replacement if there is 1/8 inch or less of the pad lining remaining or at 25,000 miles, whichever comes first. Ask the service tech to check your fluid regularly or do it yourself at the time of oil changes. You should replace the fluid if it appears to be dirty or contaminated. Most manufacturers suggest that you replace brake fluid every 20,000-25,000 miles. Rotors should last much longer, but hard braking over the life of the vehicle might lead to a different story. If you do have warped rotors, you may be able to have them trued instead of a full replacement.</p>

<p>Just follow these steps, and you’ll have stress free stopping from now on.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Selecting the Right Truck Body</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/8/selecting-the-right-truck-body</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/520155d1e4b0eb74b6636514/1375819219141/Work%20Truck%20White.jpg" /><p>These days, numerous businesses are using truck bodies for a broad array of purposes. Normally, trucks bodies are used to transfer goods from one place to another. They come in distinct sizes, forms, and features. </p>

<p>You can buy truck bodies and get them customized by truck manufacturers to fulfill your specific requirements. Also, you can get some accessories through which you can enhance the functioning, look and, safety features of these bodies. </p>

<p>Selection of truck bodies will impact on employee’s efficiency, team safety, and complete price of vehicle ownership. The procedure of choosing bodies is significantly intimidating, especially for those people who are new to fleet management. The fleet executive will not only search through OEM chassis specs, but also the various options on hand in the aftermarket truck bodies. There are some questions that you should think about, for example which one is much better? A dry van body or a service body, if a dry van body is chosen, then what should be the length? What spec chassis is right for the body and the application? These questions will give you an idea of what is best for you.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll review some helpful points that you should consider in order to select the right truck bodies.</p>

<h4 id="application">Application</h4>

<p>For what purpose will you use the vehicle? Will it drag dry goods, piping materials, construction debris, perishable products or a mixture of different items? The answer to these queries will give you a good idea of what body specification and chassis capacity you need.</p>

<h4 id="estimatedvehiclelife">Estimated Vehicle Life</h4>

<p>You have to decide that for how long you will use the vehicle. This is significant, because it will help you to choose the right item. Will you choose a body which is durable, but expensive or select an item which is cheap, but not durable?</p>

<h4 id="fuelefficiencyvsdurability">Fuel Efficiency vs. Durability</h4>

<p>Since the requirements of corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) are getting strict, automakers are relying on aluminum to reduce weight from vehicles to increase total fuel efficiency, with aluminum substances light vehicles are likely to be increased by 60% in-between 2012 and 2025, as per the report of a research firm.</p>

<p>The same trend is increasing in the truck industry, because the fleets are demanding lightweight and more fuel-efficient trucks. So, you should select a lightweight vehicle.</p>

<h4 id="advertisingandgraphics">Advertising and Graphics</h4>

<p>Automobile graphics can be a promotional thing for any firm, in this way; the advertising department can guide the fleet executive of what type of item they should choose. Graphics are a common addition in the body selection procedure although it really impacts body configuration and materials that are utilized to create that specific motor vehicle body. </p>

<h4 id="cargo">Cargo</h4>

<p>Find out how much area your cargo will need. How will your cargo be unloaded or loaded? Does your cargo need an additional security from robbery and climate? Is there any particular temperature requirement for the cargo? A few normal kinds of truck bodies are service/utility body, flatbed, dump bed, and dry van bodies.</p>

<h4 id="climateandworkingenvironment">Climate and Working Environment</h4>

<p>Decide in what area or climate the motor vehicle will be used. If it is used in extremely corrosive surroundings, coastal regions or in stern winters, then ponder other materials, for example fiberglass, aluminum and other things. But, remember one thing that these materials will be costly as compared to steel.</p>

<h4 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h4>

<p>You have to think that how you will manage the cargo loading and unloading. Will you do it from the back of the motor vehicle or the side? If you choose a cube van, what kind of size doors will you require? Would you like to include built-in stairs to reduce the worker’s exhaustion in entering and going out of the motor vehicle body? Whatever the item you select, ask for the input from the team, who will use the motor vehicle to ensure that cargo specification will optimize the worker’s abilities.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The procedure to choose truck bodies is not a daunting task; you just have to check out the details of every item, before you make your final decision. I am sure, if you keep the above-mentioned points in your mind, you will definitely be able to choose outstanding truck bodies that can fulfill all your requirements. </p>

      <title>Weighing the Benefits and Costs of Smart Key Technology</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/7/weighing-the-benefits-and-costs-of-smart-key-technology</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51f928c9e4b0608e4643709a/1375283404019/Smart%20Key.jpg" /><p>Losing your car keys could damage both your patience and your wallet, due to the rising costs of replacement ‘SmartKeys’.  </p>

<p>When jackets, handbags and armchairs don’t yield to your frantic searching, it used to be time to call in a locksmith and cough up the fees. But advances in technology mean that car manufacturers are now employing more sophisticated equipment for our car security than the simple groove cut key. Whilst these new systems are utilised for increased safety and security, it does come at a cost. Our technology may be advancing, but our margin for human error remains just as wide as the gap behind the sofa cushion.</p>

<p>Most modern day cars come with an electronic key fob, with a central locking system allowing you to lock and unlock the car remotely. However one car company went a step further in their technological advances in 1998 and coined a new term in the automotive industry.</p>

<p>When the ‘SmartKey’ was introduced by Mercedes-Benz, it brought with it the promise of eliminating that age-old statement ‘it's in here somewhere’. With these fobs, the key need only be in your bag or on your person in order for the doors to unlock, and the engine to start at the push of a button.  This system works by transmitting a unique code to your car’s onboard computer, making them extremely hard to duplicate. Whilst this offers the benefit of heightened security, it does mean that your dealership is often the only go-to should you, like an estimated 16% of Britons each year, lose your key. With no option to shop around, this means that dealerships can (and will) charge as they see fit.  </p>

<p>And how much will this set you back? It seems prices for SmartKeys are rarely below £100, leaning more towards the £200 mark in most cases, for the price of both the key and the programming. In some circumstances you will also be charged labour costs for this task. Take for example the Ford Fiesta, one of Britain's most popular cars in 2012. When searching for the cost of a replacement key, the internet is rife with complaints of quotes ranging from around £120 to £190. Even your dealership may take several days to obtain a replacement, so do bear in mind that your car may also be out of action until this is found, resulting in further costs for alternate transportation.</p>

<p>However, consolation comes for the lucky few with a motor insurance policy which covers loss of keys. The Cooperative bank and Nationwide are amongst those insurance providers who offer key cover as standard on their policies. Some premium cover options at alternate insurers will also cover you for lost and stolen keys, and will pay out for replacement locks or new keys. Key cover can also be purchased as a add on, or even a stand-alone insurance policy, but as ever be sure to read your policy fine-print carefully to ensure you are covered.</p>

<p>The automotive industry propels forward faster than ever, and traditional groove cut car keys are likely to “become obsolete” believes <a href="http://www.aaa.com">AAA</a>’s John Neilsen. So it seems that the only option for modern motorists is to wise up and bite the bullet before being bitten by a hefty pay out. Protect yourself from the inconvenience and immobilisation by purchasing a spare SmartKey in advance and keeping it somewhere safe. Alternatively, invest in motor insurance that will cover you from a large pay out if keys are lost or stolen. One things for sure, the wire in your toolbox in no longer enough to get you back into the driving seat these days, so best to be prepared.  </p>

      <title>More from Your Mileage Contest Winner</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/7/more-from-your-mileage-contest-winner</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51f7d4b4e4b04e9fcf43e213/1375196344176/Stephanie%20and%20Car.jpg" /><p>Today on the Fleetio Blog, we are interviewing Stephanie Simmons, the winner of our recently wrapped <a href="http://fleetio.com/more-from-your-mileage">More From Your Mileage Contest</a>. Her entry of 280,440 miles was the far and away winner from our pool of submissions. Our team got a chance to chat with Stephanie about how she has truly gotten the most from her vehicle. Enjoy!</p>

<p><em>Fleetio: Hi Stephanie. Tell us about yourself and your car.</em></p>

<p>Stephanie: I live in Alabaster, Alabama and commute each day to Birmingham to work for <a href="http://www.vearexperts.com/">VEAR Accident Reconstruction</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.vistaeng.com/">Vista Engineering</a>. My 2000 Nissan Xterra was purchased used in 2004, when it had 72,000 miles, and it has served as my daily driver since then.</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51f7d584e4b0dcb62541e917/1375196551900/Stephanie.jpg" /><p><em>Fleetio: What is your car care philosophy?</em></p>

<p>Stephanie: I was an airplane mechanic in the military for 8 years, so regularly checking fluids and tires comes naturally to me. When the car needs service, I take it in as soon as I can, and try to get the oil changed at least 3 times a year. I also pray each day that the Xterra will last a little bit longer. After all, God is the supplier of our needs, and He knows that I need this vehicle.</p>

<p><em>Fleetio: Most people would have traded up for another vehicle by now, but you have kept going. How come?</em></p>

<p>Stephanie: I honestly believe that if something isn’t broken, then there is no need to fix it. Aside from a few expected repairs (timing belt, valve cover, gaskets, etc.) my SUV has cost very little to operate, and saved me the worry of another car payment. Since it has lasted this long, I have been able to put away money for the next vehicle. </p>

<p>Thanks Stephanie!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New Feature: Secondary Meter</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/7/new-feature-secondary-meter</link>

<p>The new Secondary Meter add-on in Fleetio is great for any vehicle that also has a piece of equipment attached to it. For instance, if you have a street sweeper, vacuum truck or anything with an extra motor onboard, you can track the additional unit with the vehicle that it is attached to. </p>

<p>You can turn on the Secondary Meter by either creating a New Vehicle (or Editing an existing one) and then choosing sliding on the Secondary/Auxiliary Meter option, selecting your tracking units, then saving. Once you have activated this feature, the Secondary Meter status will appear on your Vehicle Overview Screen, just below the Primary Meter. </p>

<p>Read more about how to use the Secondary Meter function in our <a href="http://fleetio.com/help/vehicles/secondary-meter">Help Center.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Our Philosophy: Monthly Pricing</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/7/our-philosophy-monthly-pricing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Subscription-based, online software is not something that you see much in the Fleet Management and Maintenance industry. When we started our company, our team surveyed the options available and knew that Fleetio had to be different. Folks around the world needed an alternative to expensive, inflexible, and outdated software. Regardless of the size of your business, spending hundreds of thousands or more for a product you haven’t been able to fully test out is a bit unnerving. If that software doesn’t meet your needs, then you are out of luck.</p>

<p>With Fleetio, we sought out to change the way that people view fleet management software. Our product is constantly evolving to better suit the needs of our customers. If you sign up with us, you never have to worry about paying for annual maintenance or customer support. We also help you avoid that feeling of impending doom that comes with knowing your software will eventually be clunky, outdated, and super expensive to replace. </p>

<p>At Fleetio, we offer monthly pricing because we know that option better suits the needs of many businesses out there. Without faith in our product and employees, this would be a pretty bad decision on our part. After all, with no commitment, our customers are free to leave us whenever they so choose without penalty. We must be doing something right, however, because our retention rate for paid Fleetio plans is upward of 95%.  </p>

<p>Our team wants to thank all existing Fleetio users for their business and welcome any visitors to see what the fuss is about.<a href="http://fleetio.com/pricing"> Try out our full version for free</a> with absolutely no commitment.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>3 Simple Tips for Highly Effective Eco Driving</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/7/simple-tips-for-effective-eco-driving</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51e9a820e4b05d5b5e89dd18/1374267424780/Eco%20Driving.jpg" /><p>When you hear the term <a href="http://www.ecodrive.org/">Eco Driving</a>, what comes to mind? Be honest - are you picturing the Prius holding up traffic on your way home. Or how about the guy who never has the air conditioning on and the windows rolled up?</p>

<p>We all know it saves money to drive more efficiently, but in your business, time IS money. If your employees are on a schedule to deliver, chances are their priority is getting to the next destination as quickly as possible. How do you find the right balance between saving on costly fuel expenses and keeping your drivers happy?</p>

<p>Here are some fundamental tips that can make a difference. Many of these, I learned while piloting a solar-powered car for the<a href="http://americansolarchallenge.org/about/american-solar-challenge/"> North American Solar Challenge</a>. Believe me, when the sun is your only power source for 2500 miles worth of driving, you have to be smart with energy consumption.</p>

<h4 id="developyourdownroadvision">Develop Your “Downroad Vision”</h4>

<p>Just like a running back in football, downfield vision is essential to being an efficient driver. Anticipation is the name of the game. Unless you have regenerative brakes (which still do not fully recover lost energy), tapping the brake pedal unnecessarily is going to hurt your fuel economy. There are, of course, those unavoidable times where one must stop or slow down. Staying aware of what is happening well ahead of you will allow you to respond accordingly, and well in advance. As an extra bonus, you extend the life of your brakes with more thoughtful stops.</p>

<p>Even when driving through city traffic in the solar car, we rarely had to stop, because we were off the throttle as soon as a light changed or traffic backed up ahead. I like to think of this as “outsmarting” the majority of the driving public who respond only to what happens immediately in front of them and torment their vehicles in the process.</p>

<h4 id="knowyourrouteaheadoftime">Know Your Route Ahead of Time</h4>

<p>Since it is topical, we can look to the Tour de France for inspiration here. If you only had a limited amount of resources (whether human or vehicle power) to cover a course, how would you optimize your performance? Answer: you would plan out a strategy from start to end. It’s no secret that best finishers on the Alpe D'huez have often ridden the mountain many times, learning exactly where to apply their efforts and where to conserve.</p>

<p>For those of you who cover familiar territory on a regular basis, planning out a route probably comes as second nature. You know the shortcuts, the congested areas to avoid, and can visualize every turn. If you are trucking into uncharted territory on a regular basis, GPS guidance certainly comes in handy, but more than that - you should have a reasonable idea of what lies ahead before taking to the road. Take advantage of other resources, like Google Maps Street View and “route simulation” that comes with many navigation units these days. A minute or two of pre-trip research could save you from experiencing any headaches or unforeseen circumstances down the road.</p>

<p>Fortunately, in our race across North America, our team was given a 4-inch-thick notebook that outlined not only the directions, but what to watch out for - whether it be a potentially hazardous situation or a tricky turn that was often missed. If nothing else, ask your customer if there is anything worth knowing about the route to their location.</p>

<h4 id="drivelikethereisaneggunderyourfoot">Drive Like There is an Egg Under your Foot</h4>

<p>If you have seen the movie <em>Days of Thunder</em> you undoubtedly remember the scene where Cole learned the benefits of driving smooth. In an effort to prove this point, his crew chief, Harry, puts him on the clock - allowing Cole to run 50 laps the way he wanted, and then 50 laps under his guidance. In the end, Cole’s second stint was not only faster, but his equipment was in better shape.</p>

<p>Of course this scene is entirely fiction, but, as someone who has been around several different racing series, I can tell you that the sentiment is entirely true. My father, who raced stock cars for a number of years, used to tell me to imagine that there was an egg between my foot and the gas pedal. This visual was supposed to be a reminder that the throttle (and the brake) should be applied gradually - giving the vehicle time to build momentum proportionally. Smooth driving will burn a lot less fuel over time while saving your company on maintenance.</p>

<p>Fleet managers who monitor driver behavior with onboard devices can see the acceleration and deceleration (negative acceleration) g-forces under operation. It’s no coincidence that drivers who have high numbers (0.6g or higher, depending on the vehicle) in these categories typically get worse gas mileage than those who pull fewer g’s.</p>

<p>There you have it - simple steps that can make a big difference in overall fuel economy for your fleet.  </p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you hear the term Eco Driving, what comes to mind? Be honest - are you picturing the Prius holding up traffic on your way home. Or how about the guy who never has the air conditioning on and the windows rolled up?</p><p>We all know it saves money to drive more efficiently, but in your business, time IS money. If your employees are on a schedule to deliver, chances are their priority is getting to the next destination as quickly as possible. How do you find the right balance between saving on costly fuel expenses and keeping your drivers happy?</p><p>Here are some fundamental tips that can make a difference. Many of these, I learned while piloting a solar-powered car for the North American Solar Challenge. Believe me, when the sun is your only power source for 2500 miles worth of driving, you have to be smart with energy consumption.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>FMCSA Hours of Service Rule in Full Swing</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/7/fmcsa-hours-of-service-rule-in-full-swing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51dc7e20e4b0d1ffe698765c/1373404706493/Truck%20Parked.jpg" /><p>It has been just over a week since the new Hours of Service (HOS) Regulations from the <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association</a> (FMCSA) have taken effect. And although litigation is still pending in the United States Court of Appeals, the rules are being enforced across the country. Here’s a quick overview of what went into place on July 1, 2013. </p>

<h4 id="thechanges">The Changes</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>The maximum average workweek for truck drivers has been decreased from 82 hours to 70, representing a 15% decrease.</p></li>
<li><p>The rule also requires drivers to take at least one thirty minute break during the first eight hours of a shift. </p></li>
<li><p>Truck drivers who reach the maximum 70 hours of driving within a week are now allowed to resume if they rest for 34 consecutive hours, including at least two nights. </p></li>
<li><p>And finally, the current maximum of an 11-hour daily driving limit and 14-hour work day is retained.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The reactions so far, as you might expect, have been mixed. Some had already begun complying with the new rules since the initial rollout in February of 2013, in an effort to make a smoother transition in their trucking operations. Others have held out until July 1st. FMCA contends that these new regulations will have a notable impact on the transportation industry.</p>

  <p>"These fatigue-fighting rules for truck drivers were carefully crafted based on years of scientific research and unprecedented stakeholder outreach. The result is a fair and balanced approach that will result in an estimated $280 million in savings from fewer large truck crashes and $470 million in savings from improved driver health. Most importantly, it will save lives."   </br>-Anne S. Ferro, FMCSA Administrator </p>

      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been just over a week since the new Hours of Service (HOS) Regulations from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association (FMCSA) have taken effect. And although litigation is still pending in the United States Court of Appeals, the rules are being enforced across the country.

      <title>A Dealership Streamlines Fleet Maintenance with Fleetio</title>
      <link>/blog/dealership-streamlines-fleet-maintenance</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51d6e382e4b01ae1310eebdf/1373037443305/TroyFordPanoramic.jpg" /><p><a href="http://troyford.com">Jim Taylor’s Troy Ford</a> is a family-owned dealership that has been a mainstay in Troy, Ohio for 37 years. In addition to being an exclusive Ford dealer, they have a full service department with 9 technicians, 2 service advisors and Greg Taylor, a 14 year veteran, who serves as Director. </p>

<p>In July of 2012, Greg was in search of a <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">fleet management software</a> to help track vehicle maintenance and activities for the <a href="http://www.troyohio.gov/">City of Troy</a>. As a part of the bid package to be a contractor for fleet maintenance, Troy Ford had to find a software option that suited both their needs and those of the client. </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51d6e300e4b084dcc623f2ed/1373037313232/city%20of%20troy%20ohio%20river.jpg" /><p>Having already implemented Google Apps for much of their daily operations at the dealership, they were looking for a product with a similar feel and functionality. City officials also needed to access the software, receive email reminders for service and easily monitor maintenance activity. Fleetio, a online system that comes with unlimited users, was the perfect solution for them. </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51d6de37e4b0f798b539a0ff/1373036088160/greg%20taylor%20headshot%20crop.jpg" /><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>Fleetio’s user interface was by far the easiest of the software options we looked at. Our employees and customers were able to jump right in and learn the system immediately without any training. If we ever do have a question or feedback, the Fleetio team is extremely responsive and helpful.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="source">&mdash; Greg Taylor, Service Director</figcaption>
</figure><p>Over 20 users from both the city and dealership have Fleetio user access with a variety of roles in the system. All the preventative and routine maintenance performed by the Service Department at Troy Ford is logged in Fleetio, and city officials can see that the vehicles have been attended to. Timely emails inform both when service is due soon, so scheduling is a breeze.</p>

<p>In addition to fleet maintained by Troy Ford, the city also manages many other vehicles and pieces of equipment with Fleetio, tracking the many important assets that keep municipal operations running smoothly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to Find the Right Auto Insurance Policy</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/7/how-to-find-the-right-auto-insurance-policy</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51d2f839e4b03b50e22f57df/1372780602411/Auto%20Accident.jpg" /><p>Finding the right auto insurance policy for you can take a bit of looking. While you may not have a lot of money to put into your insurance, it's a necessity that you simply cannot go without. You may be an excellent driver with a clean record, but that doesn't mean everyone on the road is. Through no fault of your own, you could be T-boned at an intersection because someone sped through a light or neglected to see the stop sign. Insurance helps you recover from those and other kinds of accidents and should be a high priority if you want to continue driving.</p>

<h4 id="lookaroundperiodically">Look Around Periodically  </h4>

<p>Unlike other services you may be paying money for, you don't have to be tied to a specific insurance company. Each year, you could save additional money by checking the rates of other insurers and comparing them to your own. During this comparison, you should also check to make sure that the same type of coverage is offered by the others. You could find that changing your provider could not only save you money, but offer a better coverage as well.</p>

<h4 id="backgroundinvestigation">Background Investigation</h4>

<p>Always research the company you are about to use for your automobile insurance. Some will have a less than stellar track record when it comes to assistance during an accident. It's easy to conduct a basic background check of a specific company using nothing more than a search engine. If you enter the company name followed by "complaints," you would be amazed at the results you can find. This also works with just about any company you do business with. Thanks to local search engine criteria, even local businesses could be subjected to this kind of research.</p>

<h4 id="noteverypartisuniversal">Not Every Part is Universal</h4>

<p>Investigate the repair shops that the insurance company utilizes and accredits. Some smaller insurance companies will push for cheap and easy fixes as opposed to repairs using original equipment manufactured parts. Using third-party replacement parts as opposed to OEM could result in improper fitting and alterations to your vehicle that could inhibit future use. It's more of a common practice than you may realize. Your five-speed automobile could drive out with a four-speed transmission because the off-branded parts didn't fit the mounting holes for the bolts.</p>

<h4 id="knowwhatyouregettinginto">Know What You’re Getting Into</h4>

<p>Thoroughly read through the insurance policies offered by the company. Without fully understanding what you are getting yourself into, you could be on the line for paying an outrageous co-pay or deductible should an event happen. Insurance companies are in business to make money on your ability to keep from becoming involved in automobile accidents of any sort. Some will go to great lengths to ensure that they can save as much money as possible during a claim. In some cases, insurance customers actually take carriers to court in order to enforce a payment that the company was obligated to pay.</p>

<p>For the young, the cheapest auto insurance is usually the one that wins out. It doesn't matter what kinds of policies are available, and the cheapest method is usually the one that is chosen. However, in-depth knowledge of your carrier should be obtained if you want to feel fully confident that you are taken care of in the event of an accident. The cheapest policy doesn't always mean it is fair and just. You could be liable for more than you could initially afford.</p>

      <title>Your Check Engine Light is on: What to do?</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/6/your-check-engine-light-is-on-what-to-do</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51cda316e4b0bf9a1f4f9817/1372431127563/check%20engine%20audi.jpg" /><h4 id="thedreadedcheckenginelight">The dreaded Check Engine light...</h4>

<p>Its ambiguity and potential for unsightly repair bills are enough to make anyone cringe. Simply put, we all know deep down inside that we are inevitably at the mercy of our vehicles. If your car has a bad day, you probably will as well. Here is your reminder, with every crank. And this check engine light carries the possibility of so much grief, you almost want to ignore it. But should you? Let’s discuss.</p>

<p>For the sake of you, your fleet and business, completely ignoring the check engine light is a bad idea. However, before taking a vehicle in for repairs and an expert opinion, it is worth the effort to <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/car-care/what-your-check-engine-light-is-telling-you.html">troubleshoot for common problems</a>. The issue could, in fact, be something simple that you can easily rectify without a technician. </p>

<p>To give you an idea, here is an <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2012/12/07/what-that-dreaded-check-engine-repair-will-cost-you/">informative article from Forbes</a> that highlights the most common reasons for the check engine light - sorted by major manufacturers. For instance, If 17% of the time, a loose gas cap is the primary cause for your vehicle make, it’s worth checking that gas cap first. </p>

<h4 id="findingtheproblem">Finding the problem</h4>

<p>If you have a fleet of vehicles under your domain, it might be worth investing in a diagnostic tool that can plug into an OBD-II port and tell you the problem. These can be relatively affordable (less than $50 in some cases http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=15707381) and there are smartphone-compatible products that are user-friendly even for the novice.</p>

<p>The key to any repair is knowing what to expect - both from a financial standpoint and the labor involved. A diagnostic tool (combined with a <a href="http://www.obd-codes.com/trouble_codes/">quick internet search for your trouble code</a>) could give you an idea of the urgency and scope of the required service. </p>

<p>Certain issues can lead to poor performance, potentially costing much more than the price of the repair. A failing Oxygen sensor is a prime example of this. When your engine can’t calibrate oxygen intake correctly, fuel mileage and emissions can head south quickly. Similar issues result from a faulty catalytic converter, which is another common problem. Depending on your experience and skill level, you may be able to fix these and other problems yourself. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5878754/the-five-most-common-check-engine-problems-and-what-you-should-do-about-them">Lifehacker has some DIY tips</a> that could serve you well.</p>

<p>As a fleet manager, it is important to document any trouble codes in a fleet management system. With this information, you can make better decisions in the future. Using aggregate data from your <a href="http://fleetio.com">fleet management software</a>, you can easily figure out which vehicles are costing more per mile to operate, which incur the most downtime, and what useful life each make/model can be expected to have.</p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The dreaded Check Engine light...&nbsp;</h3><p>Its ambiguity and potential for unsightly repair bills are enough to make anyone cringe. Simply put, we all know deep down inside that we are inevitably at the mercy of our vehicles. If your car has a bad day, you probably will as well. Here is your reminder, with every crank. And this check engine light carries the possibility of so much grief, you almost want to ignore it. But should you? Let’s discuss.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>New Feature: View Recent Vehicles</title>

We realize that user roles define much of how you use Fleetio, and being able to see your specific information is key. </p>

<p>Along these lines, we have revamped the Vehicle List on the Fleetio Dashboard to list assets in order of most recent. That way, you can easily see which vehicles need attention and which have recently been accessed. If you only deal with part of your fleet, then those are the vehicles that will always be at the top of your list - making it easier to access the information that matters to you.</p>

<p>Just another way we are building Fleetio around our users. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Revenue Generating Fleet</title>
      <link>/blog/the-revenue-generating-fleet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51c4994fe4b079ce7c20c50a/1371838801186/Cabs.jpg" /><p>More often than not, we tend to view your company vehicles and equipment as a financial burden. The truth is, however, that your fleet can play just as big of a roll in getting your business in the black as it can in racking up unforeseen expenses. The key to optimizing your fleet operations is becoming proactive about maintenance and responsible operation.</p>

<p>All too quickly, a fleet of vehicles can become a huge liability. Irresponsible driving, poor maintenance habits and improper management can lead to debilitating expenses as well as lost business. Rather than attending to problems after they happen, a fleet manager can put processes in place that can keep everything running smoothly from the start. </p>

<h4 id="therightvehicleforthejob">The Right Vehicle for the Job</h4>

<p>A big part of operating a successful fleet is <a href="http://www.afdc.energy.gov/conserve/rightsizing.html">choosing the right vehicle for the job</a>. In some cases, you have to be prepared for a variety of situations, so your drivers may have to carry an assortment of equipment and take larger vans/trucks. If your service can be segmented, right-sizing is a great way to reduce overhead and maximize your revenue per vehicle. Scaling appropriately for what is needed out of your fleet will cut down on fuel expenses.</p>

<h4 id="driveraccountability">Driver Accountability</h4>

<p>One of your largest operating expenses will undoubtedly be fuel. With an intelligent fleet management software or tracking device, you can get a clear view of how efficient your drivers are. These tools will also ensure that your company’s valuable assets are being used correctly and for their intended use. <a href="http://www.worktruckonline.com/article/print/story/2010/07/what-fleet-managers-should-know-about-idle-limiters.aspx">Excessive idle time</a> or unnecessarily heavy acceleration may seem like a small infraction, but can really add up over time.</p>

<h4 id="preventingdowntime">Preventing Downtime</h4>

<p>Having a vehicle unexpectedly out of service can be a huge headache - because not only does it cost money for the repair, it also costs you time where that vehicle could be generating revenue. Set the correct maintenance schedule for each automobile or piece of equipment and stick to it. <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleet maintenance software</a> with email reminders will keep all stakeholders aware of the schedule, letting employees know when a vehicle needs to be taken in for service. All it takes is one missed maintenance to cause a serious, and avoidable problem.</p>

<h4 id="findingthenumbersthatmatter">Finding the Numbers that Matter</h4>

<p>In accounting for your fleet, tracking the right numbers make all the difference. Lease rates, fuel expenses and service costs are all very important, but when it comes down to it, the Cost/Mile figure for operation is one number that says it all. Make sure you find a <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">Fleet Management Software</a> that produces this number automatically for each vehicle. Set goals for each vehicle and your for the fleet as a whole. Before you know it, you could be looking at your fleet in a completely different light - as a source of revenue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tips for Fleet Vehicle Purchasing</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/6/tips-for-fleet-vehicle-purchasing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51ba253be4b03a11938d3313/1371153726713/Car%20Dealer.jpg" /><p>As one of the most expensive assets your company will likely purchase, a fleet vehicle (or many of them) is a big investment. Likewise, you want to get the best value possible up front while still getting the right car, truck, van etc. for the job at hand. Here are some helpful tips that can guide you through the process and ensure you and your company are getting the best deal.</p>

<h4 id="considerallofyouroptionsinspecingvehicles">Consider all of your options in specing vehicles</h4>

<p>When deciding what parameters and features your fleet vehicle must have, try not to eliminate viable alternatives. Consider the scope of what the car or truck will be used for, what options are necessary and where there might be some breathing room. Unless they are absolutely necessary, make a concerted effort to avoid making any brand or manufacturer-specific specs. Simply put - having an open mind is the key to getting a great deal.</p>

<h4 id="workdirectlywithfleetsalesrepresentatives">Work directly with Fleet Sales representatives</h4>

<p>This may sound like a no brainer, but there is a distinctive difference between a typical sales department and that which solely focuses on fleet vehicles. Those in fleet sales tend to be more straightforward and no-nonsense. Their job is to move volume. They work with smaller margins and usually handle financing directly. Skip the hassle and deal with the people who are ready to sell vehicles to you at wholesade prices.</p>

<h4 id="drivealloftheoptionsfirst">Drive all of the options first</h4>

<p>Before talking pricing, you should visit nearby dealerships and test out all of vehicles that are on your potential list. Get the shopping part of the way, so you can get down to business later. During the test drive process, take good notes. If you have a lengthy list, they might all run together after a while. Put your shoes in the drivers that will be using these vehicles day in and day out. Will they be comfortable, safe, etc. and be able to perform their jobs effectively? </p>

<h4 id="checkaroundforthebestpricing">Check around for the best pricing</h4>

<p>Once your list is complete and the vehicles are ranked accordingly, it is time to hit the phones or jump online for quotes. Don't be afraid of going outside of your area or region to see what kind of pricing you can get. Let the fleet sales rep know exactly what you want and see what they can do. Don't let the invoice price deter you from asking for a better deal.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Buy-a-New-Car-Through-Fleet-Sales">Wikihow</a> "Most dealerships get anywhere between $200,000 and several million dollars in volume bonuses; hence, their 'invoice price' is not usually a true representation of their costs. But knowing the vehicle's MSRP is always a good place to start.</p>

<h4 id="knowwhatincentivesanddiscountsareavailable">Know what incentives and discounts are available</h4>

<p>As you might imagine, quantity has a lot to do with available discounts. This isn't the whole story, however. <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/220323">Preferred pricing</a>, as it's known, is open in many cases to business owners who purchase or lease as few as five vehicles. Each manufacturer also sets their own required quantity for Fleet purchasing:</p>

<p>General Motors requires businesses to buy or lease five or more new vehicles in a 12-month period. Toyota asks that a company operate or plan to operate 10 or more, but those 10 can be a mix of vehicles from different manufacturers. Honda's fleet sales have no quantity restrictions.</p>

<p>For a list of available 2014 fleet incentives on major OEMs, check out this article on <a href="http://www.automotive-fleet.com/news/story/2013/06/select-automakers-release-2014-fleet-incentives.aspx">Automotive Fleet</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At the time, she was searching for a better fleet management system. With a required download to each device and limited reporting capabilities, the software Barlow Jeeps had in place simply did not meet the needs of their business. Fleetio, a <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/vehicle-maintenance-software">web-based application</a>, provided a refreshing alternative.</p>

<p>Being a tour operator and business owner, Nena doesn’t have a lot of time to sit in front of a computer. And who would want to with that view? Her day consists of a multitude of tasks, from training drivers to inspecting the fleet and orchestrating rentals. Barlow needs a <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/vehicle-maintenance-software">vehicle maintenance software</a> to be as nimble as the rock crawling Jeeps in their stable, with easy access and data entry for an operation constantly on the go.</p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>Fleetio is quick, easy and intuitive. We travel a lot, and love that we can access it from anywhere, whenever we want to look up something or enter maintenance updates. Thanks to Fleetio, our team is saving at least 2-4 hours every week on fleet management tasks.<span>&#148;</span>

Since Fleetio has helped streamline vehicle management responsibilities, Barlow can now devote more time to growing the business and creating happy customers.</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51ae2fd8e4b0ef57556f07d1/1370370011791/Screen%20Shot%202013-05-14%20at%208.34.55%20AM.png.55%20AM.png?format=original" /><p><em>About the Customer</em> <br/>

      <title>Fleetio Update: Loan/Lease Tracking</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/6/fleetio-update-loanlease-tracking</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51acdcd4e4b08f6a770d4658/1370283222422/Screen%20Shot%202013-06-03%20at%201.12.21%20PM.png.21%20PM.png?format=original" /><h4 id="wehaveonceagaintakenyourfeedbacktomakeoursoftwarebetter">We have once again taken your feedback to make our software better.</h4>

<p>Fleetio now helps you track lease/loan data for your fleet of vehicles or equipment. We have added a tab on each Vehicle Page where you can store all of the important information related to financing a fleet. As an added bonus, you'll be able to add your loan company and manage them as a Vendor in Fleetio.</p>

<p>Because we believe in making the most of your fleet data, we have designed this new feature to automatically calculate your total payments so far and display progress - letting you know how much further there is to go before a vehicle is paid off. That's handy!</p>

<p>Add your loan/lease information today by going to a Vehicle Page and selecting "Edit Loan/Lease." As always, the Fleetio team would love to hear your feedback and thoughts on this new feature. Drop us a line inside the app through the feedback window or send an email to feedback@fleetio.com.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Growth of CNG Fleets: By the Numbers</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/5/the-growth-of-cng-fleets-by-the-numbers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51a7b22de4b0bcef0588031e/1369944623663/CNG%20station%20.jpg" /><p>At a recent <a href="http://nafa.org">NAFA</a> Fleet Management Association meeting, we had the pleasure of hearing a presentation on the growth of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles and insfrastructure in the US. For most fleets, the decision to switch to an alternative fuel is a big decision, and primarily motivated by the numbers. So, with that in mind, we have compiled some of the facts and figures about CNG and Natural Gas Vehicles (NGVs) for you. Thanks to Bob Strickland, of <a href="http://corridorcleanfuels.com/">Corridor Clean Fuels</a>, for the information.</p>

<h4 id="thestateofngvs">The State of NGVs</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Right now there are about 130,000 NGVs in the U.S. There are currently about 15 million NGVs worldwide and that number is expected to increase to 25 million by 2015.</p></li>
<li><p>There are 1204 total CNG stations in the US as of March, 2013: 577 are Public and 627 are Private.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="emissions">Emissions</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Replacing one diesel garbage truck with a natural gas garbage truck can reduce emissions equivalent to removing 325 cars from the road. -EPA</p></li>
<li><p>Natural Gas Reduces emissions of CO2 (25%), Carbon Monoxide (90%), Mercury (100%), Sulfur Dioxide (99.9%), Particulates (91.3%), Nitrogen Oxide (78.4%)</p></li>
<li><p>Natural Gas is the cleanest commercially available alternative transportation fuel on the market</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="vehicleavailability">Vehicle Availability</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Light &amp; Medium Duty: GM currently provides OEM CNG vans and 2500 series bi-fuel natural gas pickup trucks. Dodge has a CNG bi-Fuel Ram pickup. Ford has Natural Gas F-250 &amp; F-350 bi-fuel pickups. Honda produces dedicated CNG Civics.</p></li>
<li><p>Heavy Duty: 8.9L Engine – Currently Available, 11.9L Engine – Summer/Fall 2013. Major OEMs with options: Freightliner, Volvo, Mack, Kenworth.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="statefederaltaxcredits">State &amp; Federal Tax Credits</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Louisiana has a 50% NGV station tax credit plus 50% for NGV OEM or conversion cost premiums.</p></li>
<li><p>Florida legislature just approved bill to exempt NGV’s from paying state fuel tax for five year period.</p></li>
<li><p>Georgia’s PSC allocated $11.5 to build CNG stations. The state also provides vehicle credits of 10% of the vehicle cost with the credit not to exceed $2500. </p></li>
<li><p>See a complete list of federal and state NGV tax incentives <a href="http://www.ngvc.org/incentives/federalTax.html">here</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="pricingcomparison">Pricing Comparison</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>U.S. retail CNG prices range from around $1.00 to $2.00 per gallon equivalent below gasoline and diesel fuel.</p></li>
<li><p>January 2013 National Averages: CNG - $2.10, Diesel - $4.12, Gasoline - $3.29, Propane - $2.68</p></li>
<li><p>See below for pricing trends since 2000. </p></li>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Interesting that Autocar is not mentioned as far as a CNG/LNG heavy truck supplier. They pioneered the gas truck in the Waste industry, worked out all of the early issues and have produced more CNG gas powered trucks than any other OEM. They also were the main test OEM for the refuse industry as far as the ISX-12G</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

You can find this option by clicking on your Username and then Edit Profile. </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51a663d4e4b08ee9f749ce82/1369859030136/Screen%20Shot%202013-05-29%20at%203.10.05%20PM.png.05%20PM.png?format=original" /><p>Once added, you will see your profile picture in the upper right hand corner of the page. Whenever you make a comment in Fleetio, your smiling face also shows up next to it. </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51a665eee4b00e9e42e0818a/1369859567961/Screen%20Shot%202013-05-29%20at%203.31.08%20PM.png.08%20PM.png?format=original" /><h3 id="vendorwebsitemap">Vendor Website &amp; Map</h3>

<p>Since many of our customers order parts and services online for their fleet, we've made it easy for users to link directly to their vendor sites. You'll now see an added column for websites in the Vendor Section. As an added bonus, you can also click on the location pin to see a vendor in Google Maps. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Meet the new Fleetio</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/5/meet-the-new-fleetio</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/519ee9b2e4b018f5767b4ced/1369369011804/256YDpqb2y7KxYZ.png" /><p>We're excited to announce the launch of the all new Fleetio. Our mission is to make it easy to manage a fleet of vehicles and equipment. We learned a ton by talking to countless customers and listening to feedback, then spent a lot of time thinking about how we can make Fleetio easier to use on a day-to-day basis.</p><p class="p1">We overhauled the design and user experience to make Fleetio better, and make way for whole host of new things to come. This major upgrade makes Fleetio more elegant, more delightful to use, without removing any features.</p><p class="p1">Here are some highlights of the new design:</p><h3>Navigation</h3><p class="p1"><strong></strong></p><p class="p1">This is one of the biggest changes you'll notice. We&nbsp;moved the main navigation to a left sidebar, and added icons to make it easier to navigate.</p><p class="p1">This new navigation approach makes it easier to get around Fleetio today, and allows room for expansion for all the great features we have coming.</p><p class="p1">We also added a better secondary navigation for certain sections of Fleetio, like the Vehicle profile.</p><h3>Cleaner interfaces</h3><p class="p1"><strong></strong></p><p class="p1">We polished all areas of Fleetio, making information easier to read so you can quickly find what's important.</p><h3>Vehicle List</h3><p class="p1"><strong></strong></p><p class="p1">We redesigned the Vehicle list to make it faster and easier to find the vehicle you're looking for. You can now&nbsp;search by name, license plate, VIN, location, status or type.</p><h3>Search</h3><p class="p1"><strong></strong></p><p class="p1">We added lightning-fast search in more places throughout Fleetio, like Vendors and lists within the Account Settings area.</p><h3>Consolidated Reminders</h3><p class="p1"><strong></strong></p><p class="p1">Service and Renewal Reminders have been consolidated under the "Reminders" navigation item in the Vehicle profile. Now you can see what's due or due soon for a vehicle, all in one place.</p><h3>Comments</h3><p class="p1">We renamed "Notes" to "Comments" throughout Fleetio to promote communication around a fleet. We're putting a greater emphasis on collaboration and keeping everyone up-to-date about their fleet. More on this soon.</p><h3>Reports</h3><p class="p1"><strong></strong></p><p class="p1">We added a Report title and Account name in printer-friendly version for all reports. Searching and filtering reports is even easier, so you can slice and dice your data as needed.</p><h3>Mobile</h3><p class="p1"><strong></strong></p><p class="p1">Fleetio's mobile-specific version was not affected, but the new "main" design is mobile-friendly too and is especially useful on tablets.&nbsp;Menus and search are hidden by default but can easily be displayed via toggle buttons.</p><h3>Looking forward</h3><p class="p1"><strong></strong></p><p class="p1">Soon we'll be adding more "account-wide" views, allowing you to easily browse things like fuel and service entries across the account.</p><p class="p1">Our goal is to improve the everyday experiences of using Fleetio, so watch closely for more updates and new features.</p><p class="p1">We hope you enjoy the new changes as much as we do.</p><p class="p1">Tony Summerville<br>CEO</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Lowering the DUI Limit – Will it Make our Roads Safer?</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/5/lowering-the-dui-limit-will-it-make-our-roads-safer</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/519e198ae4b01d9008905003/1369315724679/Screen%20Shot%202013-05-23%20at%208.28.19%20AM.png.19%20AM.png?format=original" /><p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.ntsb.gov/">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (NTSB) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/us/legal-limit-drunken-driving-safety-board.html?_r=1&amp;">recommended that states reduce the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for driving from 0.08 to 0.05</a>. If the proposal is accepted, anyone found driving with a 0.05 BAC level or greater could be subject to prosecution and arrest. For some context, a 180-lb male will reach a peak BAC level of 0.05 somewhere between two and three drinks consumed within an hour (see chart below for peak levels).</p>

<h4 id="peakbacbasedonalcoholdrinksperhour">Peak BAC Based on Alcohol Drinks per Hour</h4><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/519e160ae4b03e84e794fe0e/1369314850649/Screen%20Shot%202013-05-23%20at%208.12.33%20AM.png.33%20AM.png?format=original" /><p>According to NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman, of the approximately 10,000 drunk-driving related fatalities each year in the United States, nearly 1000 of those in 2011 were caused by drivers with a BAC level between 0.05-0.07. The NTSB says extensive research shows that lowering the limit would help significantly reduce drunk driving accidents, injuries and fatalities.</p>

<p>Not everyone is convinced. The measure has met expected resistance from restaurant and beverage trade organizations like the <a href="http://www.beerinstitute.org/">American Beer Institute</a> which says adopting the lower limit would “criminalize perfectly responsible behavior”. Even <a href="http://www.madd.org/">Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD)</a>, expected to support the NTSB in such efforts, is remaining neutral on the idea, choosing to focus its efforts more on distracted driving measures to prevent texting and driving as well as the NTSB’s other recommendations like mandatory <a href="http://www.smartstartinc.com/">Breathalyzer interlock devices</a> installed in vehicles of anyone with a DUI conviction.</p>

<p>While traffic fatalities as a whole have been reduced over 50% since the early 1980s when many states had a BAC limit of 0.15, the NTSB and other safety advocates say the U.S. can do much more to keep our roads free of alcohol-impaired drivers. Much of the civilized world, including roughly two-thirds of Europe, has a driving limit of 0.05 BAC or lower, while the last reduction in the limit in the United States to 0.08 came in 1998 after a long political fight. Advocates of the NTSB’s proposal say lowering the limit would not only reduce drunk driving injuries and fatalities, but the measure would send a strong message to those who push the envelope and routinely drive with the impaired vision and sensory perception common at BAC levels between 0.04-0.08.  </p>

<p>Whether the NTSB’s recommendations are adopted or not remains to be seen, but the measure clearly faces a long, challenging road ahead.</p><p>About the Author:

      <title>Fleet Management for Small Business</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/5/fleet-management-for-small-business</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/519cf3fae4b0245c51b5c62a/1369240573038/Plumber%20Small%20Business.jpg" /><p>When someone asks for your job title, do you have to think about it for a second? If so, you probably work for a small business. At smaller companies and startups, it seems that the lines are blurred between departments, responsibilities and roles. Simply put, you do whatever is needed to make the business a success.</p>

<h4 id="sharetheresponsibilityofmanagingyourvehicles">Share the responsibility of managing your vehicles.</h4>

<p>Likewise, if your operation depends on vehicles to get the job done, managing that fleet falls under the responsibility of a number of people. Ideally, you want everyone who touches the fleet to play a role in keeping up with the vehicles - in tracking maintenance schedules and data logging. If one person fails to keep up with their responsibilities, it can cost the company a great deal of money in repairs as well as lost time. It also compromises the overall safety of your fleet. </p>

<h4 id="findasystemyoucanusefromanywhere">Find a system you can use from anywhere.</h4>

<p>The best way to keep up with vehicles effectively in a small to medium-sized business is to implement a fleet management software that all stakeholders can use from a variety of devices. It isn't entirely practical to have a "fleet manager" per se, so the associated tasks are left to a group effort. </p>

<p>Your fleet is constantly moving, and so are the employees that utilize it. It only makes sense that data can be entered on the go and from anywhere. <a href="http://fleetio.com">Web-based software</a> and cloud storage allow for this kind of mobility. With an easily accessible platform, you can also ensure transparency across the entire operation.</p>

<h4 id="savetimeandenergywithanintuitivesoftware">Save time and energy with an intuitive software.</h4>

<p>It also helps significantly to have a <a href="http://fleetio.com/vehicle-maintenance-software">system that is extremely easy to use</a>. This saves valuable time in onboarding and keeps you from having to train everyone who uses the software. No matter someone's primary business function, they should be able to jump in with an intuitive product and start working immediately.</p>

<h4 id="trackthemetricsthatmatter">Track the metrics that matter.</h4>

<p>If you had a Fleet Manager, he or she would be responsible for closely monitoring expenses and performance of your company vehicles. With the right data (input regularly by your team), you can narrow down the metrics that truly matter to your bottom line and see how to operate more effectively. After all, fleet management isn't simply about preventing disaster, it is also about optimizing these valuable assets and helping the bottom line. With a good vehicle management system, you can determine how much a vehicle costs per mile, how efficiently drivers are operating and what vendors are giving you the best prices. Make it easy to find these figures as well as other important numbers and check them reguarly. </p>

<p>Follow these steps and see the difference a well-run fleet can make for your small business.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Innovative Safety Feature Protects Tunnels from Disaster</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/5/innovative-tunnel-safety-feature-for-oversized-trucks</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="intrinsic" style="max-width:100%"><div class="embed-block-wrapper" style="padding-bottom:56.20609%;"><div class="sqs-video-wrapper" data-html="&lt;iframe width=&quot;854&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/NoTMC-uxJoo?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" data-provider-name="YouTube"><div class="sqs-video-overlay" style="opacity: 0;"><img data-src="http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/NoTMC-uxJoo/hqdefault.jpg" data-load="false" data-image-focal-point="0.5,0.5" /><div class="sqs-video-opaque"></div><div class="sqs-video-icon"></div></div></div></div></div><h3 id="keepingoversizedloadsfromenteringtunnels">Keeping Oversized Loads from Entering Tunnels</h3>

<p>In order to make tunnels in Sydney, Australia safer, engineers have developed <a href="http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/usingroads/tunnels/index.html">intelligent safety features</a> that help notify trucks in advance that they will not fit. The video above features a potential disaster that was avoided thanks to these new innovations.</p>

<h4 id="howdotheydoit">How do they do it?</h4>

<p>Sensors before the tunnel detect whether or not a truck is too tall, then flashing signs appear specifically in front of the offender - telling them to stop immediately. If these signs fail to garner the attention of the driver, then tunnel operators unleash a water curtain at the entrance as a last line of defense. So far, this has prevented a number of potential accidents in the Sydney area.  </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51927ccee4b011d27a00a4f5/1368554704624/Screen%20Shot%202013-05-14%20at%2012.54.03%20PM.png.03%20PM.png?format=original" />]]></content:encoded>

<h3 id="firstletsaddressafewmisnomersaboutsoftwaretoday">First, let's address a few misnomers about software today:</h3>

<h4 id="1youneedoneproductthatdoeseverything">1. You need one product that does everything.</h4>

<p>Companies have grown quite accustomed to spending a lot of money on massive systems that are meant to accomodate all office and administrative functions. While this approach was considered optimal for consolidating all of your company data and activities into one place, it forced all employees to use the same basic (and probably not optimal) platform. </p>

<p>With Application Program Interfaces (<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/API.html">API</a>), online platforms, integrations and the ease of data exchange, apps have the capability to talk to one another like never before. This allows for developers to focus on building brilliant solutions for specific problems. Accountants can find software tailor made for their needs, and businesses can choose a <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleet Management Software</a> that talks to fuel records, data tracking devices and more. </p>

<h4 id="2youhavetodownloadsoftwaretoyourserversorvariousdevices">2. You have to download software to your servers or various devices.</h4>

<p>Cloud-Based producs are reachable from any device that has internet access. Furthermore, many of them can operate entirely without ever requiring anything to be downloaded. For those used to the days of buying CDs in a box, this concept can be a bit eye-opening. </p>

<p>The great thing about web-based applications is that you can access them from most internet-capable devices. Onsite servers are rendered obsolete (what a relief). If you are a company that is constantly on the go, access from anywhere is a huge benefit.</p>

<h4 id="3softwareisexpensiveandrequiresalongtermcommitment">3. Software is expensive and requires a long-term commitment.</h4>

<p>Software as a Service (SaaS) is not a new concept, but it has become popular as an alternative to traditional software. With SaaS products, you can sign up for a monthly subscription without any long-term commitment. Typically, this monthly fee will include all product updates as well as customer support and in some cases, you receive the option to have <a href="http://fleetio.com/tour">unlimited users</a> at no additional charge.   </p>

<h4 id="4youandyouremployeeshavetobetrained">4. You and your employees have to be trained</h4>

<p>Simply put, if you have knowledge of your industry, there are many software options that you can jump into and start using immediately. Apple and the iPhone generation can be considered largely responsible for leading a wave of consumers that now demand intuitive applications. While it might take more effort to design something that is both functional and powerful, there are plenty of products available that manage to simplify tasks without sacrificing features. So, as you are scouring the internet for the perfect software, don't just settle for something that gets the job done. Find an option that you can and will use daily without pulling your hair out.   </p>

<h3 id="sohowdoyougetstartedsearching">So how do you get started searching?</h3>

<p>In order to find what you are looking for, it is important to know what the requirements of your business are. Ask yourself the following:
* How many people will be using the software?
* What devices do they have?
* What features are absolutely necessary and which would be nice to have?
* Do you need a custom software/app or can you work with an existing platform that will more than likely save you money?</p>

<p>Once you have those questions answered (or at least have a good idea) there are a number of places you can begin looking. Google search works, but you there also software/app specific marketplaces online that will give you a comprehensive list of what is out there. <a href="http://capterra.com">Capterra</a>, <a href="http://getapp.com">GetApp</a>, and the Apple Store are great places to browse. These typically have user reviews and a full listing of features or screenshots that will help in your decision.</p>

<p>Some software companies offer <a href="http://fleetio.com/pricing">free, no commitment, full version trials</a> of their product, and with online options, you can be signed up testing them out in a minute or less. Do your homework, and your company will see the difference that can be made when you choose the right software.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Greening Your Fleet: 5 Keys to Real Success</title>
      <link>/blog/5-steps-to-a-green-fleet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/518811d2e4b0851a91a02017/1367871957876/Hybrid%20Tractor%20Trailer.jpg" /><p>There are a lot of articles out there centered upon the “Green Fleet” philosophy. As a responsible fleet manager or business owner, you are probably already striving toward Green objectives, whether or not you label them as such. Being proactive and placing a high importance on your operating efficiency can really make a difference. And if your company is looking for some recognition for its efforts, or simply looking to run a more effective fleet, going Green could really pay off in the long run. So how do you start “Greening” your fleet today?</p>

<h3 id="setattainablegoalsandmapoutyourpathtosuccess">Set Attainable Goals and Map out Your Path to Success</h3>

<p>A good manager always finds a way to measure improvement, because, at the end of the day, the numbers do not lie. If you put an objective in place, find the metrics that are going to be indicative of success or failure. For instance, if you want to reduce your overall fleet expenses, look at your key statistics for becoming more efficient and break your plan down into the steps that get you to the final goal. Find reasonable benchmarks that can help you and your employees build momentum toward a greener fleet. Here are some of the key ideas that should be on the list.</p>

<h3 id="theoverarchingthemereducingfuelconsumption">The Overarching Theme: Reducing Fuel Consumption</h3>

<p>You knew this was coming, and are probably already doing your best to reduce the fuel consumption of your fleet. The problem, most will find, is figuring out how to make a notable and sustainable difference without replacing all of your vehicles or making your drivers miserable. With so many variables involved (terrain, load, route, etc) you can’t always get the entire picture with a MPG calculation from your <a href="http://fleetio.com">fleet management system</a>. What you can determine, however, are the general guidelines that will lead to an improved fuel efficiency.</p>

<h4 id="cutdownonidletime">Cut Down on Idle Time</h4>

<p>This is a big one, and a number that we see as a big influencer in fuel consumption. One hour of idle time is roughly equal to 30 miles of driving. If your drivers are keeping their trucks running all day, either as an escape from summer heat or out of convenience, the added expense can really add up. Information from an onboard <a href="http://fleetio.com/vhm">Vehicle Health Monitor</a> or GPS Unit can make this statistic painfully obvious. But what can you do to implement a change? There are a few proven options that can help curb idle time without stirring an overwhelmingly negative reaction</p>

<p>Rather than hand down mandates on idling, you can reward drivers for running their vehicles less. With this system, it becomes a conscious decision for the employee, and more often than not, the reward is more of a motivator than the fear of consequences. Read more about ways to structure your <a href="http://www.nctcog.org/trans/air/vehicles/waystoreduce.asp">incentive program</a>.</p>

<p>For larger trucks, the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) could be an option for idle time reduction. These cooling units can help curb your fuel consumption without sacrificing driver comfort on long or overnight trips. <a href="http://fleetowner.com/running-green/jbs-carriers-named-green-fleet-year-fleet-owner-and-wix-filters">Savings of up to 16%</a> have been seen on trucks that have been outfitted with APUs.</p>

<h4 id="regularmaintenance">Regular Maintenance</h4>

<p>This should be a no brainer, but the importance can’t really be stressed enough. By virtue of being comprised of thousands of moving parts, a vehicle’s efficiency can really take a hit if you don’t keep everything in check. Simply getting regular oil changes (with the <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/1/regular-vs-synthetic-oil-which-is-right-for-your-fleet">right oil</a> for your car/truck) and replacing the air filter as needed can make a huge difference in fuel economy. The Green Fleet concept is all about being environmentally responsible, so it has just as much to do with what goes into your vehicles as what comes out. In addition to harming air quality, a vehicle that spews harmful pollutants is going to give your company a bad rap. Preventative maintenance will keep things on the straight and narrow. Just find an easy to use fleet management software and set your service schedules and reminders so you never miss one.</p>

<h4 id="specingmoreefficientvehicles">Spec’ing More Efficient Vehicles</h4>

<p>If you are in the market for new vehicles, you are in the proverbial driver’s seat to make big strides in curbing in your fleet’s fuel bills. Vehicles are more fuel efficient than ever, and with tighter regulations coming down the pipeline, that trend should continue. It would be worth the time and effort (especially at a larger company) to modify your vehicle specs and include a minimum fuel economy rating for all new vehicles of various sizes. </p>

<p>The key here is knowing exactly what your operating requirements are. Take historical data and driver feedback to gather the miles driven annually, the power needed for different vehicles as well as the overall scope of work that the fleet performs. With this information, you’ll be able to calculate probable payback periods for implementing new options, which will probably be more expensive.</p>

<p>Since many work trucks are also outfitted with additional equipment, you have the opportunity to increase efficiency by <a href="http://www.greenfleetmagazine.com/article/51437/6-ideas-for-specing-greener-trucks-without-breaking-the-bank">recommending lighter or more aerodynamic add-ons</a>. Do a little homework up front and you could save quite a bit going forward. </p>

<h4 id="alternativeenergysources">Alternative Energy Sources</h4>

<p>When you talk about greener automobiles, alternative fuel options tend to be at the forefront of discussion. <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/my-time-in-a-natural-gas-fleet">Compressed Natural Gas</a> (CNG) and Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming much more attainable than they have been in years past. If the tax incentives and infrastructure in your area are favorable, doing some research on your options might be a good idea for your fleet. If you are already equipped with annual mileage figures, calculating the ROI based on projected MPG ratings can be pretty easy. Just be sure to take into consideration the availability of your fuel source, refill time and overall range. If your fleet is widely dispersed and covering unpredictable routes, alternative fuels may not be an option for you yet.</p>

<h4 id="wheretherubbermeetstheroad">Where the Rubber Meets the Road</h4>

<p>In addition to regular maintenance, being green has a lot to do with your vehicles rolling down the road as efficiently as possible. If you tires are set at the wrong pressures, then everything else you do to reduce fuel consumption can be negated. A visual inspection every day by your drivers is a good way to ensure that you are getting the most out of your tires. This is an easy win.</p>

<p>Most vehicle types now also have a tire option available that has a lower rolling resistance. In some cases, it is a redesigned tread pattern. For eighteen wheelers and other large trucks, tests have shown that the new single <a href="http://www.alliedoil.com/2011/03/the-benefits-of-wide-base-tires/">wide-base tire</a> concept performs better than two side-by-side tires in certain cases. </p>

<p><strong>Go forth and be green. With these keys, you can start seeing a difference tomorrow.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Racing Technology: From the Track to Your Garage</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/4/auto-tech-from-the-track-to-your-garage</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/517fe800e4b0ce9de8c16de8/1367337019161/photo%20(18).JPG" /><p>I remember when Formula 1 teams first introduced the kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) a few years ago. At the time, it sounded like rocket science (or something out of the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Zero_" title="video_game)(video_game">F-Zero</a>). The principle makes sense: harness wasted energy from braking to give a concentrated power boost for passing down the straightaways. In practice, however, such a system was quite complicated. At first glance, it seems a little over-the-top, even for F1. If you are looking at racing as a proving ground for viable features, what's the chance this would ever go mainstream for the average, non million-dollar, vehicle?</p>

<h4 id="speakingofspendingmoney">Speaking of spending money...</h4>

<p>In college, I led a group of engineers that designed, built and raced a <a href="http://wp.auburn.edu/soa/">solar powered car</a> 2500 miles across North America. While quite expensive at the time, the motor (with a whopping 11 HP), batteries, aerodymanic design and <a href="http://auto.howstuffworks.com/under-the-hood/trends-innovations/top-10-car-tech-from-racing.htm#page=9">lightweight composites</a> are now all making their way into the vehicles manufactured today. As it pertains to this article, the regenative braking feature of the motor has proven to be especially pertinent. In essense, that's where the idea for KERS came from - reverse the flow of electricity and a motor turns into a generator. You just need a place to store that energy and a system smart enough to regulate it.</p>

<h4 id="sohowdoesthetransitionhappen">So how does the transition happen?</h4>

<p>Traction control, intelligent suspensions, and many other ideas have made the leap from racing to commuter vehicles. The challenge, as you might expect, is taking cutting edge (and super expensive) ideas from the race track and making them both affordable and practical for long-term use. Fifty laps in a closed environment isn't exactly replicating the average daily driving routine. So we consumers have to wait patiently for a few years...</p>

<p>When <a href="http://www.egmcartech.com/2013/04/30/video-volvo-confirms-research-and-development-on-f1-style-kers-hybrid-system-for-mass-production/">Volvo recently announced that it had developed a new engine using KERS technology</a> to reduce fuel consumption by 25%, we all finally got to see the payoff for years of racing development. The flywheel design, in testing, has not only improved fuel economy, but it has also proven to make the vehicle faster by adding power to the rear wheels. Initially, the new KERS is being tested in Volvo's S60 model, but expect growing adoption as other automakers start to catch on. The concept could be coming to your fleet vehicles soon. </p>

<p>Feedback from our customers identified the need to set different "Due Soon" thresholds for each reminder. We are happy to share with our users new functionality that will allow you to customize that threshold. You will notice this option as soon as you open a reminder in <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleetio</a>.</p>

<p>Just another way we are building our <a href="http://fleetio.com">fleet management software</a> around you.</p>

      <title>So You Can't Attend the NAFA 2013 Institute &amp; Expo?</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/4/so-you-cant-attend-the-nafa-2013-institute-expo</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51784397e4b0be6d32e9982a/1366836119866/Fleet%20Management%20Expo.jpg" /><p>As a fleet manager, it is important for you to be aware of what is going on in your industry. Changes in technology, the regulatory environment and best practices can really be impactful to your business. If you were unable to attend the NAFA 2013 Institute &amp; Expo, we want to give you some insight into some of the things that are being discussed and presented. So here are a few key ideas floating around at “the Fleet Management Industry’s Largest Event.” </p>

<h4 id="managingaglobalfleet">Managing a Global Fleet</h4>

<p>For fleets that have regional or even international span, dealing with differences in units, currencies and languages can be difficult. The technology now exists for fleet management operations to work together even though they are on different continents. Cloud storage and <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/4/fleetio-flicks-fleet-safety-and-black-boxes-with-gary-johnson">web-based fleet management software</a> allow for employees to access the same database from different locations, all while seeing their data in regional settings. </p>

<h4 id="reactionstochangesinpolicy">Reactions to Changes in Policy</h4>

<p>The fleet management industry is perpetually responding to regulatory changes. 2013 is no different. Whether we are talking about <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/topics/hos/index.htm">driver restrictions</a> or <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/4/fleetio-flicks-fleet-safety-and-black-boxes-with-gary-johnson">black box regulations</a>, it is important to be abreast of how your company will be impacted.</p>

<h4 id="newadvancesinfleettracking">New Advances in Fleet Tracking</h4>

<p>GPS has been around for some time now, but the devices are certainly more capable than ever. Also, the introduction of <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/4/prweb10641042.htm">bluetooth and cell phone connectivity</a> to vehicle diagnostics have broadened the scope of traditional GPS. Overall, you are going to see more comprehensive data available with more lower cost options as well. In a nutshell, better data means you can make better decisions about your fleet.</p>

<h4 id="alternativefuelsandanelevatedfocusonfuelefficiency">Alternative Fuels and an Elevated Focus on Fuel Efficiency</h4>

<p>Not only are the options for fueling your vehicles becoming more diverse, the way vehicles utilize that fuel is also changing. Natural gas availability and pricing is bringing <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/my-time-in-a-natural-gas-fleet">CNG</a> and LNG options into the conversation for a variety of fleets. EVs, propane (autogas) and biofuels are also becoming viable for some businesses. The early adopters for these alternative-fuel fleets are mostly niche industries or operations with predictable driving patterns, but expect more growth in the coming years as availability scales accordingly.</p>

<p>In addition to moving toward more fueling options, car companies have developed new ways to increase fuel economy across your fleet. Start/stop technology, aerodynamic innovation, and even tire design can have a big impact on reducing fuel expenses for a company. With these new options, however, a vehicle could certainly cost you more up front. As a fleet manager, one of your challenges will be realizing the fuel savings and knowing whether or not a payback is worth the added investment. </p>

      <title>What Does it Mean to be Car Care Aware?</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/4/car-care-awareness-month</link>

While just about every cause has a week, month or day to call it's own, we at Fleetio are passionate about what it means to be Car Care Aware. This is why we have our Forever Free Plan, which allows you to manage <a href="http://fleetio.com/pricing">5 vehicles or less for free</a> with our online software. </p>

<p>Our ultimate goal is to provide a platform that makes it easy to get the most out of your fleet - whether you have one car or thousands, because more efficient and longer lasting vehicles can have a big impact. If everyone focuses on curbing fuel usage, reducing unnecessary wear and tear and making the roads safer, then we can all benefit.</p>

<p>Being car care aware is simply adopting a proactive mindset about servicing and maintaining your vehicles year round (not just during the month of April). Staying constantly in tune with the condition of your fleet can save your company money, prevent unexpected downtime as well as keeping the whole operation running smoothly.</p>

<p>If you don't already have a preventative maintenance program in place, then it is time to adopt one. Find the <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/3/finding-the-right-maintenance-schedules">necessary services for your vehicles</a> and set up easy-to-track reminders that ensure you will have work done at the recommended mileages. A little effort can go a long way in protecting you against potential issues down the road.  </p>

      <title>Take Our Fleet Software for a Free Test Drive</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/4/take-a-free-test-drive</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/516db1fee4b048c970492a2c/1366143951628/Test%20Drive%20Leaf%20JMR_Photography.jpg" /><p>As with any important asset for your business, you undoubtedly prefer to test drive a few vehicles before deciding on the right one for the job. It's only natural to want to know that each car or truck is going to fit the needs of your company before making a purchase. </p>

<h3 id="ourphilosophy">Our Philosophy</h3>

<p>At Fleetio, we believe that you should be able to do the same with your fleet management/vehicle maintenace software. You shouldn't have to rely on a sales pitch, carefully selected screenshots or a well-rehearsed demo to make your decision. Like selecting a vehicle for your fleet, the full experience only comes when you are sitting comfortably in the driver's seat.</p>

<h4 id="thefullfleetioexperience">The Full Fleetio Experience</h4>

<p>We think you have the right see exactly what our software can do for your business <strong>without any obligation.</strong> This is why we do not require a credit card or any detailed information to get you started on any of our <a href="http://fleetio.com/pricing">14 day trials or our Forever Free Plan.</a> We also give you access to the <strong>full version</strong> of our software, because otherwise, it is tough to get a clear picture.</p>

<p>Once you do upgrade to a paid plan, there is no contract to sign or any long-term commitment to be afraid of. <strong>Your data and users transfer automatically.</strong></p>

<p>Fleetio is also month to month, so you can cancel at any time. </p>

<h4 id="butisnttheretrainingandinstallationinvolved">But Isn't There Training and Installation Involved?</h4>

<p>Why does a free trial work? Because our software is easy to use, it lives online (meaning nothing to download) and our customer support is excellent. Fleetio is designed to be powerful but also extremely intuitive - so you don't have to be an expert to use it, but you sure will feel like one.</p>

<p>If you already have <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/help/importing-vehicle-data/">vehicle data that needs to be transferred</a> to your trial account, we are more than happy to help.</p>

<p>At Fleetio, we are all about honesty, transparency, and a great customer experience. So what are you waiting for? <a href="http://fleetio.com">Start your test drive today.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Gary Johnson works at <a href="http://vearexperts.com">VEAR, Inc.</a> where he and his team analyze accidents and utilize black box recordings to find the root causes. We very much appreciate his contribution to the Fleetio Blog and hope that you learn something from our interview. We certainly did!</p>

<h4 id="hereisatranscriptofourinterview">Here is a Transcript of our Interview:</h4>

<p>Hi, my name is Gary Johnson. I'm with VEAR, Incorporated. VEAR is an accident reconstruction company, specializing in forensic engineering as it pertains to vehicular accident reconstruction.</p>

<h4 id="whattypeofaccidentsdoyougetinvolvedwith">What type of accidents do you get involved with?</h4>

<p>One of the services we provide is the download, preservation and interpretation of black box data in either passenger cars or commercial vehicles.</p>

<h4 id="howareblackboxrequirementschanging">How are black box requirements changing?</h4>

<p>The mandate that just came out, citation 49 cfr, Code of Regulations 563, which is now a federal law that requires manufacturers who record crash data to make the tools commercially available to retrieve and access this recorded crash data.</p>

<h4 id="howisthisgoingtochangeaccidentreporting">How is this going to change accident reporting?</h4>

<p>When I was a police officer, unless we actually did an accident reconstruction, we would always put "unknown" for vehicle speed. With the black box data, they can start putting speeds on the report.</p>

<h4 id="whatotherinformationcanyoudownload">What other information can you download?</h4>

<p>Typically it is vehicle speed, engine speed, throttle position, brake switch circuit status. Those were the big four in the early years. With the proliferation of stability control and yaw control and memory getting cheaper. Initially, there was just longitudinal axis accelerations - now you can see the left and right accelerations and you can see rotational acceleration. On some cars you can see steering wheel position or the degrees of rotation. Some cars will tell you if the stability control, ABS, or cruise control were active at the time of the crash.</p>

<h4 id="isthisdifferentforheavytrucks">Is this different for heavy trucks?</h4>

<p>The number of parameters recorded in the trucks are much more: engine speed, throttle position, engine load, clutch status, brake status and fault code status for two minutes. Some of the trucks even record daily engine usage in two hour blocks of time and you can compare that to driver logs to see if the driver was reporting accurately - whether the truck was actually running, off or in an idle state.</p>

<h4 id="canblackboxdatabeaccessedatanytime">Can black box data be accessed at any time?</h4>

<p>In dealing with passenger cars: yes. It can be downloaded at any time, but data is recorded in circular buffer that is anywhere from 5 to 20 seconds long typically. In order to write the data from the buffer into the permanent memory, you've got to either deploy your airbags or rattle your car hard enough for it to think about deploying airbags - called a "non-deployment event." It will also write that data to a file. It's not like a police officer can pull you over and see what your driving behavior has been, because, at most, there is only 20 seconds worth of memory.
Some manufacturers have a 5 mi/hr change in speed threshold in order to write data, even in a non-deployment event. In order to get a 5 mi/hr delta V (velocity), you pretty much have to crash the car.</p>

<h4 id="whoownsthedatainyourvehiclesblackbox">Who owns the data in your vehicle's black box?</h4>

<p>There are a lot of privacy issues associated with who owns the black box data. It is still being fought out in the courts and legislatures. It boils down to whoever owns the car owns the data. By the time we get involved, the cars are usually totaled. They have been purchased by the insurance company and they have ownership of the data. In most states, the data in the box transfers with the ownership of the vehicle.</p>

<h4 id="whatinyourexperiencearesomeofthemaincausesoffatalcrashes">What, in your experience, are some of the main causes of fatal crashes?</h4>

<p>The government puts out a lot of vital statistics on crashes, but what I have seen is very simple: it's people not driving appropriately for their environmental conditions. They are not slowing down in the rain, they are not increasing their distance between them and the car in front of them in the rain or at night. They are overdriving their headlights. It's what I call "compound problems," which is following too close, driving too fast and being distraction. Those are the problems that I see.
In a smaller number of cases, especially with heavy trucks, maintenance is the cause. On a typical 18 wheeler, you have 10 sets of brakes. I have seen one truck, of course it had been wrecked, that had three operational brakes. The other seven were either inoperative or defective to the point where they were not working as well as they should have been.</p>

<h4 id="whattechnologydoyouthinkwillcurbpotentialdangeroussituations">What technology do you think will curb potential dangerous situations?</h4>

<p>I would like to see more cameras in vehicles - especially if you have a fleet. I like Drive Cam, which runs about $1,000 a piece. It's a dual camera unit (one facing out the windshield and another on the driver and occupants) and is a great way to modify behavior.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Manage ALL Service Types + Descriptions</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/4/manage-all-service-types-descriptions</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5167338ee4b00ae130d1aa86/1365717903146/Screenshot_4_11_13_4_29_PM.png" /><p>A Service Type in Fleetio is a maintenance or service activity you perform on a vehicle. Fleetio comes pre-populated with some common Service Types (like Oil Change, Rotate Tires, etc.) but you used to not be able to edit the "built-in" Service Types. Until now.</p>

<p>We recently released an update that makes ALL Service Types manageable for an account. Don't want to see "A/C Compressor Replacement"? Delete it. Want to rename "Oil Change" to "Replace Oil and Filter"? Go for it.</p>

<p>Now you can organize and name Service Types however you like and reduce clutter. Feels good, doesn't it?</p>

<h4 id="servicetypedescriptions">Service Type Descriptions</h4><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/516733f5e4b0f61ca310136b/1365718006324/Screenshot_4_11_13_4_40_PM.png" /><p>We also added an optional description field for Service Types. If you have generic Service Type names like "PM A" or "100,000 mile service", the description is a great place to add more details about what the maintenance activity entails.</p>

<p>If a Service Type description is present, the name will typically be underlined with a dotted line throughout Fleetio. Clicking the Service Type name will show the full description.</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51673430e4b060cd9198595f/1365718067683/Screenshot_4_11_13_4_33_PM.png" />]]></content:encoded>

      <title>4 Keys to Implementing a Fleet Management System at Your Company</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/4/ae6eby6dhd87e7ececatdqrfv2of7r</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51647b6de4b09c82172276ef/1365539695460/Mechanic%20Meeting%20City%20of%20Marietta%20GA.jpg" /><p>If you do not already have a <a href="http://fleetio.com">fleet management system</a> at your company, or are looking to upgrade to a more modern solution, there are certain things you should know that will make adoption of a new software much easier. As you already know, making widespread changes to the way your business operates is not only a technological or workflow shift, it is a cultural one as well. If you know what to expect up front, all of the pieces should fall into place with minimal effort.</p>

<p>We talk to a number of companies who come to us with no established system of keeping up with fleet information and responsibilities. Many have been using excel spreadsheets, file folders, or even a whiteboard to track regular activities, expenses and maintenance schedules. </p>

<p>The goal is to help your company make that transition to a fleet management platform that will put everyone on the same page; allowing for a more efficient and transparent operation. Here are some helpful tips that will help make the process smooth and painless.</p>

<h3 id="geteverythingorganized">Get Everything Organized</h3>

<p>In making the transition to a new product, platform or method of fleet management, it is always important to have all the right information at your fingertips. An effective software will provide an easy to access home for all vehicle data, so put every important piece of information in there. It may take some extra effort to track down every VIN, purchase record, invoice, etc. but it will pay off whenever you need to find what you are looking for. Going forward it will be handy to have everything stored in one place instead of scattered about. If your fleet software is cloud based, then you can look up information or enter data on the go from any device.</p>

<h3 id="setanexpectationofresponsibility">Set an Expectation of Responsibility</h3>

<p>A great Fleet Manager empowers other employees to play their part in maintaining vehicles and keeping good records. Reinforce the essential connection between a well-run fleet and a healthy bottom line for the company. For most organizations, vehicles are a means to an end - whether you are delivering products or providing a service, but they are essential nonetheless. Unexpected downtime, costly repairs or unsafe behavior can have a big time impact on your business. By building that connection and the underlying <a href="http://www.government-fleet.com/channel/software/article/story/2006/09/how-to-implement-a-fleet-preventive-maintenance-program.aspx?prestitial=1">importance of fleet responsibilities</a>, you will let everyone know what is expected. </p>

<p>Preventative maintenance software is often based around email notifications to assigned people, so let everyone know that they are accountable for checking those messages and acting accordingly. Set thresholds that will alert them before a service activity is scheduled and then have another come at the time it is actually due. This redundancy allows for people to easily make time on their calendar to take the car or truck in and acts as a buffer. Establish a maintenance routine for all vehicles and stick to it.</p>

<h3 id="promotedriverbuyin">Promote Driver Buy-In</h3>

<p>Fleet management software today allows for data entry from just about anywhere and from a variety of devices. For smaller companies that share fleet responsibilities, giving drivers user permissions and the ability to enter information for their own vehicle is a great idea. With that access, of course, comes the responsibility to enter accurate and timely information. </p>

<p>We have seen varied results from the odometer entries drivers enter at the time of filling up. Some take the time to punch in the right number, others do not. However, more accurate mileage inputs seem to occur when the employee knows that data field is more than simply a means to being able to pump gas. If a fleet manager emphasises the importance of entering correct information (since it affects mpg calculations, service schedules, etc.), the result is usually positive.</p>

<h3 id="targettherightmetrics">Target the right metrics</h3>

<p>Get off on the right foot by highlighting the metrics that matter to your fleet and your company. Cost per mile is a good one to concentrate on - it will give you a very good overall picture of how your vehicles operate. Service activities and fuel expenses contribute to this number so it will tell you precisely how much it should cost to drive one more mile or kilometer.</p>

<p>Driver performance can make up to a <a href="http://www.inc.com/guides/201109/5-tips-for-trimming-fuel-costs.html">33% impact on fuel economy</a>, so monitoring miles per gallon for all of your vehicles is also key. Gas or diesel are probably going to be a large chunk of your monthly expenses, so make it easy to track usage. By <a href="http://fleetio.com/fuel-cards">integrating with fuel cards</a> or entering accurate mileage entries at the pump with a mobile device, your software can automatically calculate this for you and show trends for fuel economy over the life of a vehicle. Plain and simple, if you establish predictable figures throughout your fleet, budgeting each year becomes much more accurate.</p>

<p>With this groundwork, you will have a much better shot at maintaining an efficient fleet and a successful company. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New in Fleetio: Archiving Vehicles</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/4/new-in-fleetio-archiving-vehicles</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleetio users have utilized our various <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/drop-us-a-line">feedback channels</a>to let us know that they would like an option to archive vehicles. Our team recognizes that in the lifecycle management of your fleet, it is handy to be able to keep a vehicle for your records, without having it included in an active list or your account total.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that as of today, you can start archiving vehicles in Fleetio.</p>

<h3 id="howtoarchive">How to Archive</h3>

<p>From the Vehicle List screen or Vehicle Profile screen, you can select the dropdown menu on any vehicle and choose to archive. </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/515dabd9e4b02ae078556bed/1365093338441/Archiving%20Vehicle.png" /><h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<h4 id="readonly">Read-only</h4>

<p>Archived vehicles are read-only, meaning they can't be edited. Associated records such as service and fuel entries can only be viewed. In order to edit an archived vehicle, you must first restore it.</p>

      <title>Extending the Life of Your Fleet Vehicles</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/4/extending-the-life-of-your-fleet-vehicles</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5159e735e4b01cd3b0225e45/1364846391345/Denali%20HD%20David%20Guo.jpg" /><p>Regardless of the price of gas, economic conditions, or the state of your company, it is always important to get the most out of your fleet vehicles. Being expensive assets, you want to optimize their use and ensure that at the time of resale or retirement, those cars, trucks, or vans are still in the best possible operating condition. Here at Fleetio, we have put together a helpful list of things you can do to ensure that you get the most out of your fleet.</p>

<h4 id="beanexpertoneachvehicle">Be an Expert on Each Vehicle</h4>

<p>Having the right information is key to being a succesful fleet manager. In order to give your vehicles the prescribed maintenance they need, you have to find out exactly what that should be. Rather than mass apply service schedules across an entire fleet, check the owners manual for each vehicle make/model and use <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/3/finding-the-right-maintenance-schedules">handy online resources</a> to lay out the right maintenance routines. Using factory recommended parts, fluids and methods can make a big difference in the long run.</p>

<h4 id="carefullytrackpreventativemaintenance">Carefully Track Preventative Maintenance</h4>

<p>Once you know the correct schedules, stick to them. Make it as easy as possible to follow the recommended maintenance by setting <a href="http://fleetio.com">helpful email reminders</a> that notify you and your team when service activities are due. Once maintenance has been completed, find a convenient place to keep your records for later reference. <a href="http://fleetio.com/fleet-management-software">Fleet management software</a> and other tools are great for this.</p>

<h4 id="keepacleanfleet">Keep a Clean Fleet</h4>

<p>Like it or not, your drivers are going to keep their vehicles in better condition if they are consistently clean. A tidy truck (on the <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/3/how-to-protect-the-interior-of-your-fleet-vehicles">inside</a> and out) is going to reinforce a standard of accountability. Cleaning and protecting vehicles regularly is also going to guard against unhealthy buildup that could cause issues down the road.  </p>

<h4 id="checkthetires">Check the Tires</h4>

<p>As we have <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/2/taking-care-of-your-tires">previously discussed</a> on the Fleetio Blog, tires are the great indicators for your vehicle. If the alignment is off or handling is poor, the first place to look is where the rubber meets the road. Irregular wear is a tell-tale sign that a check-up is in order, and putting off tire maintenance can cause more severe issues down the line. Take a daily look at the tires (or ask your drivers to) and help your vehicle stave off problems.</p>

<h4 id="operateresponsibly">Operate Responsibly</h4>

<p>This one may come as no surprise, but driving a vehicle with care will undoubtedly help it last longer. This includes giving the engine time to warm up properly before each trip. If you have vehicles or equipment that are used infrequently, be sure to crank them up and get the working parts in motion every week or so.</p>

<p>Tracking driver behavior is a reliable way to curb unhealthy habits. GPS and other <a href="http://fleetio.com/vhm">data gathering hardware</a> can give fleet managers valuable information that will help in establishing guidelines in how to operate your company vehicles responsibly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Customer Feedback on Fleetio's Fuel Card Integration</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/3/customer-thoughts-on-fleetios-fuel-card-integration</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we rolled out our <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/1/why-fuel-cards-are-great-for-fleet-management">Fuel Card Integration</a> a few months ago, our team knew that it was going to be a great feature for our current and future Fleetio customers. The response was overwhelming, and many were excited about the opportunity to streamline their fleet management and fuel reporting.</p>

<p>Rather than tell you about how great it is, we wanted to let Fleetio users do the talking. Here is some of the feedback we received from our satisfied customers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Integrating our fuel cards lets us automatically collect odometer readings from drivers, which triggers preventative maintenance alerts in Fleetio and helps keep our fleet on the road." </br>
  -Brady Wilson, <a href="http://www.servprobirminghamsouth.com/">SERVPRO of Birmingham</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p></br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The fuel card integration with Fleetio allows our growing company to get a clear picture of our total fleet costs, helps us identify inefficient vehicles and keeps all of our vehicle information in one convenient repository." </br>
  -Gary McCandless, <a href="http://www.fayettepartsservice.com/">Fayette Parts Service</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p></br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Fleetio's integration with Fuelman gives us powerful insight into our fuel costs - a major expense that is usually hard to shed light on. Now we can see the true cost per mile to fuel each vehicle, helping us make informed decisions to increase our profit margin."</br>
  - Dan Kratohvil, <a href="http://www.inlineelectric.com/">Inline Electric Supply</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p></br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I would sum the overall fuel card integration up in one word, Seamless! I met with Fleetio, they said they would take care of it for me, and that’s the last I heard. Next thing I knew, I was downloading reports utilizing our fuel cards which they had imported." </br>
  - Mark Voltz, <a href="http://www.joerns.com/">Joerns</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>For just $1 per card per month, you can automate fuel data entry for your fleet.</strong></p>

      <title>By the Numbers: Saving Money With Preventative Maintenance</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/3/by-the-numbers-saving-money-with-preventative-maintenance</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51508267e4b0b803bb96aed0/1364230761627/Under%20the%20Car%20-%20Moto@Club4AG.jpg" /><p>Inevitably, with vehicle ownership comes responsibility. And every 16 year old can tell you that they have been lectured ten times over about taking care of their new ride. But often that mindset is kept purely out of fear of being broken down on the side of the road or having to go out of pocket for a large maintenance expense.</p>

<p>Seldom do we consider the fact that staying current on preventative maintenance (PM) can actually save you money - not just in the long haul, but on a daily basis. With <a href="http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/">gas prices being where they are currently</a>, the savings from PM is even more visible. If you are a fleet manager, then multiply the numbers across your fleet and see what a difference you can make.</p>

<p>Our team here at Fleetio has done some research in order to provide you with real data that shows what regular auto service can do for your budget and bottom line:</p>

<h4 id="tirepressures">Tire Pressures</h4>

<p>We've talked a lot about <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/2/taking-care-of-your-tires">tires</a> on the Fleetio Blog, and we continue the emphasis here to reiterate that keeping your tires in check (or not) can have real consequences. Simply maintaining the factory recommended pressures can save around $99 per year and improve mileage 3.3%.</p>

<h4 id="airfilters">Air Filters</h4>

<p>Putting off changing a dirty air filter can cost you well beyond the price of a new one. Excessive buildup can cause clogging and reduce your mpg by as much as 10%. Remember - fuel needs air to combust and power your vehicle, and starving your intake can really hurt performance. Conversely, keeping a clean air filter has the potential to save you <a href="http://www.moderntiredealer.com/article/story/2013/03/spring-car-care.aspx">$300 per year</a>.</p>

<h4 id="therightoil">The Right Oil</h4>

<p>We have also discussed <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/1/regular-vs-synthetic-oil-which-is-right-for-your-fleet">motor oil characteristics</a> on the Fleetio Blog - because it is a big deal. The right oil for your car or truck leads to a happy engine. So it goes to show that choosing the correct oil type can improve your vehicle's efficiency by 1-2% per year, or roughly $60 worth.</p>

<h4 id="enginetuning">Engine Tuning</h4>

<p>Depending on the age of your vehicle, you could increase operating  efficiency up to 4% by having the engine tuned properly. For your personal or company fleet, that type of savings can really add up.</p>

<h4 id="keepingyourvehicleclean">Keeping Your Vehicle Clean</h4>

<p>It should come as no surprise to you that carrying around a lot of
extra stuff (instead of <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/3/how-to-protect-the-interior-of-your-fleet-vehicles">cleaning out your vehicle regularly</a>) can have a notable effect over the course of a year. An extra 100 pounds in your car or truck can put a 2% hurt on fuel efficiency. </p>

<p>Make it easy to keep up with preventative maintenance and more in an easy to use <a href="http://fleetio.com">fleet maintenance software</a>. </p>

<p>Note: estimates based on annual driving of 15,000 miles, fuel economy of 20mpg and approximately $4 per gallon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Hybrid Vehicle Maintenance</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/3/hybrid-vehicle-maintenance</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/514355c6e4b0d8515d82b176/1363367368302/Prius%20-%20Beth%20and%20Christian.jpg" /><p>Twelve years ago, Hybrid Electric Vehicles were primarily in the hands of brave early-adopters. The concept was new, and all most people knew about these cars was that they looked funny, were slow, and had a very impressive mpg rating. There were still a lot of questions about reliability and maintenance costs.</p>

<p>Today, you can by a hybrid version of just about any popular model from the major manufacturers. And now that most of those early Priuses (or is it Priusi? I never know...) are over 100,000 miles (and have probably had a battery replacement by this point) this is a great time to talk about the real differences between Hybrid and regular vehicle service - both from a cost and overall hassle standpoint. If you are looking for a fleet of hybrids or just one for your daily driver, we hope that this information is useful to you.</p>

<p>With any new automotive technology, it is inevitable that replacement parts are going to be a bit pricey. For a hybrid, these big ticket items are primary electrical - batteries, motor, regenative braking system, etc. Early battery replacements were costly enough to keep someone up at night, but inclusive warranties as well increased production have helped eased such concerns.</p>

<p>Today, batteries can still be a large expense, but it is a far cry from horror stories in the early days. Estimates range from about <a href="http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1078138_toyota-hybrid-battery-replacement-cost-guide">$3,000-$5,000</a>, and you can receive a $1,000-$2,000 core credit for your old battery. Most current models have warranties that cover battery replacement for 8 years/100,000 miles (up to 10 years/150,000 miles in some states), and tests have shown that <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/fuel-economy/the-real-costs-of-owning-a-hybrid.html">180,000 miles is very possible</a> on the same pack.</p>

<p>The takeaway with many of the hybrid systems is that, although more costly up front, they actually help reduce the wear and tear on other mechanical parts. Regenative braking not only recharges the battery, but it also <a href="http://www.driverside.com/auto-library/the_real_costs_of_owning_a_hybrid-55">reduces dependency on the rotors and discs</a>, therefore allowing for longer intervals between maintenance.</p>

<p>In Toyota's hybrid design, there are basically zero wearable parts in the transmission, so you don't have to worry about the fluid changes and maintenance that are typically required. The electric motor in most hybrids should be checked along with your other major components around 100,000 miles just to make sure it is in working order. In theory, you should be able to go longer between oil changes on the engine because it is technically being used less, but that all depends on your usage profile. </p>

<p>In summary, the maintenance costs for a hybrid aren’t all that different than a traditional vehicle. For the most part, any extra services that need to be performed will more than likely be offset by the money saved on maintaining your other mechanical parts that are being used less frequently. Depending on the actual fuel economy, your driving habits and the upfront expense, a hybrid could really make sense for you or your fleet. </p>

<p>Log service and fuel expenses in your <a href="http://fleetio.com">vehicle maintenance software</a> and see for yourself!</p>]]></content:encoded>

With numerous workers smudging, scratching and spilling inside a car, not to mention certain weather conditions slowly eating away at carpets, it is important to play some defense when concerning your fleet vehicles.</p>

<p>Fleet owners would be wise equipping each vehicle with a rag and some sort of cleaning solution. It could also be a good idea to get workers in the habit of wiping down the dashboard, steering wheel and windows at the end of each days work, even if they are not dirty. This small change could not only get the vehicle looking clean, but it will preserve the interior for a longer time. </p>

<p>It would also be a good business practice to clean the vehicle upholstery once a month and finish the job with scotch guard to keep it safe until the next cleaning.</p>

<p>Other products, like <a href="http://www.huskyliners.com/">Husky Liners® vehicle floor mats</a>, provide even better protection than scotch guard. These mats are particularly helpful in the winter months when moisture gets dragged into a car. The liner will ensure none of the moisture touches the interior of the vehicle, keeping it clean for jobs to come. </p><p><em>About the Author: Tara Duncan is the Director for Marketing Strategies at <a href="http://www.huskyliners.com/">Husky Liners</a>.

      <title>Accidents Happen: Fleet Safety and Reporting Tips</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/3/fleet-accident-reporting</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/513e392ae4b0883109790335/1363032365649/Car%20Crash.jpg" /><p>Wrecks aren't fun for anyone. But as a fleet manager, accident reporting is a necessary part of the job. Proper documentation is key to protecting your driver and company. It also ensures that you will have usable data to reference and help prevent further accidents with company vehicles. Here are some helpful tips that will come in handy if and when there is an automobile accident in your fleet.</p>

<h3 id="beforeanaccident">Before an Accident</h3>

<h4 id="implementpreventativemeasures">Implement Preventative Measures</h4>

<p>Daily safety checks and inspections are great for establishing a mindset of safety. You can track these activities in your <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleet Management Software</a> to be sure they are being done with regularity. Properly maintaining your vehicles and keeping them in running order will ensure that the car or truck will not put the driver at risk. A quick walk around the vehicle before departing is also a good way to check for any unforeseen objects while backing or leaving a dangerous area.</p>

<p>If you are utilizing GPS Telematics or a <a href="http://fleetio.com/vhm">VHM</a> to track driver behavior, continually check for signs of dangerous driving (ie unsafe braking or acceleration and speeding). Operators who are are constantly being monitored can have an accident <a href="http://www.gpsinsight.com/gps-tracking-benefits/improve-driver-safety">up to 38% less than those who are not</a>.</p>

<h4 id="traindriversonaccidentavoidance">Train Drivers on Accident Avoidance</h4>

<p>Training drivers on both how to avoid an accident and what to do if one does occur is essential to operating a safe fleet. You can find a list of <a href="http://www.accidentavoidance.com/">Accident Prevention Courses</a> online and save your company money on insurance by having employees participate in <a href="http://fleet.idrivesafely.com/driver-safety-training.html">certified programs</a>.</p>

<h4 id="educateemployeesonwhattodoafteranaccident">Educate Employees on What to do After an Accident</h4>

<p>If an accident does occur, you want all of your drivers to know what to do. It is a great idea to hold regular meetings on auto safety and include this information. Their behavior after an incident can have a huge impact on the outcome, so being ready is key.</p>

<h3 id="afteranaccident">After an Accident</h3>

<h4 id="documentation">Documentation</h4>

<p>First and foremost, be sure that any vehicle involved in an incident moves to a safe location out of harms way. Because the driver is the first person on the accident scene, he or she should begin gathering information as soon as possible. They key is to be thorough in documentation and make every effort to collect the following: </p>

<ol>
<li>Names &amp; Addresses of drivers/occupants of any vehicles involved in addition to other injured persons and witnesses</li>
<li>Their operator's license numbers</li>
<li>Insurance company names and policy numbers</li>
</ol>

<p>Having a form in the vehicles to record this information is a good idea. Photo documentation is also important, so encourage your drivers to use cameras on their mobile device or keep a disposable one in every vehicle. </p>

<p>Important: Drivers should not discuss fault with, or sign anything for anyone other than an authorized representative of your company, a police officer, or a representative of the insurance provider.</p>

<h4 id="internalpolicyandcompanydocumentation">Internal Policy and Company Documentation</h4>

<p>Every fleet manager should have an established documentation and review process in place for when an accident does occur. Aside from storing documents and photos securely in your <a href="http://fleetio.com">fleet management system</a>, you should also keep hard copy records on hand for a <a href="http://hrtrainingcenter.com/readArticle.asp?AID=1000565">minimum of 7 years as required by law</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on the cause of the accident, driver remediation, corrective action or further training may be a good idea.  </p>

      <title>New in Fleetio Mobile: Reminders, photos and more</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/3/new-in-fleetio-mobile-reminders-photos-and-more</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We've made several enhancements and released some new features to the new <a href="http://m.fleetio.com">Fleetio mobile site</a> since <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/3/fleetio-mobile-version-is-open-for-beta-testing">announcing the beta version last week</a>. Here are just a couple of a new things we added or tweaked.</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/513a6807e4b0e14e302f8a82/1362782216183/218ccd1fc47dc4bd8d377697fa51b748.png" /><h3 id="reminders">Reminders</h3>

<p>View Service and Renewal Reminders on one screen for any vehicle in the mobile version. Now you can quickly see when the next oil change is due or insurance coverage expires from one screen.</p>

<p>By the way, we'll be reorganizing the regular Fleetio web version soon to include the single "reminders" view, as it just makes a lot more sense to see maintenance reminders as well as other scheduled tasks in one place.</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/513a682ae4b0b854a1b067bb/1362782251203/5507db7b4441b3f0a5749b876f0fcd71.png" /><h3 id="vehiclephotos">Vehicle photos</h3>

<p>We added photos to the vehicles list screen making it easy to find the right one when scrolling through a long list of vehicles. The photo marked as the "default" photo will be the one to appear in the list.</p><h3 id="loginpage">Login page</h3>

<p>Several users experienced issues logging in to the mobile site. Fleetio now provides more details about the error or reason that a login failed. Please let us know if you continue to have issues.</p>

<h5 id="keepthefeedbackcoming">Keep the feedback coming</h5>

<p>Please <a href="https://fleetio.uservoice.com">keep the feedback coming</a> on ways we can make the mobile version even better.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Customize Your User Profile</title>

This is especially handy if your company and fleet span across different states, countries or even continents. </p>

<p>To access your User Profile while in the software, simply click on your username and a drop down menu will appear. Then select <strong>Edit Profile</strong>.</p>

<p>On the Edit Profile screen, there are a number of settings you can personalize. Change your username and email information, select a specific time zone for your business location, choose a fuel economy setting, store driver's license information, or change your password from this page.</p>

<p>The Fuel Economy setting is very handy for switching to different regional preferences for vehicle efficiency. Fleetio allows you to display in<a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/"> miles per gallon US</a> (MPG US), <a href="http://www.fuel-economy.co.uk/stats.shtml">miles per gallon UK</a> (MPG UK), Liters (Litres) per 100 kilometer (L/100km) and kilometers per Liter (Litre). You can switch back and forth at any time to see your data in different units.</p>

<p>Read more about these customizeable settings on our <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/help/settings/user-settings/">Help Page</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Finding The Right Maintenance Schedules</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/3/finding-the-right-maintenance-schedules</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51364745e4b00e99bdc5509c/1362511685939/Pouring%20Oil.jpg" /><p>Preventative maintenance is the key to keeping your fleet running smoothly. But in order to stay ahead of any potential problems, it is important that you know what services to schedule and at what mileages they should be due. Otherwise, you could just be waiting for parts to fail. </p>

<p>Fueled by chicken biscuits and pots of coffee, our team set to work evaluating different sites and resources that will help you find the right PM schedules for your fleet. Below, are the tasty fruits of our labor. The <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleetio</a> family hopes that it serves you well!</p>

<h3 id="majormanufacturersites">Major Manufacturer Sites</h3>

<p>It may come as no surprise, but the companies that made your vehicles have a pretty good idea of when they need to be serviced. If you have a uniform fleet, these are your best bet.  </p>

<h4 id="fordfleet2"><a href="https://www.fleet.ford.com/maintenance/maintenance_schedules/getymm.asp">Ford Fleet</a></h4>

<p>Ford's maintenance search tool may not be the prettiest, but it gives you great information. You can lookup by Vehicle Year, Make and Model, or there is a handy VIN search that is quick and easy. Ford also allows you to select the Driving Condition that most accurately describes the use of your car or truck. We looked up a 2010 Ford F-150 to give an idea of the recommendations provided.</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51361ed0e4b055d8b61a3734/1362501329480/Ford%20F-150%20Service%20Interval.png" /><h4 id="gmcertifiedservice1"><a href="http://www.mycertifiedservice.com/Services/SimplifyMaintenance.jsp">GM Certified Service</a></h4>

<p>GM makes it a little more difficult to find a detailed service schedule. There are two main pages you can use, however, that are handy if you are using a GM Certified Service location to perform regular maintenance. To find upcoming maintenance requirements, check out this <a href="http://www.mycertifiedservice.com/Services/SimplifyMaintenance.jsp">link</a>. You can plug in your last service and GM will fill in the gaps - telling you what the next service should consist of.</p>

<p>On the GM Fleet site, you can find <a href="http://www.gmfleet.com/maintenance-tips.html">general maintenance guidelines</a> and a <a href="http://www.gmfleet.com/content/dam/gmfleet/global/master/nscwebsite/en/Home/Shared_Resources/PDFs/GMC1-FCO-12-07183-548%20TechTip%20Digital.pdf">Fleet Service Toolbox</a>. There is also a handy <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/owners/chevy-manuals.html">library of GM vehicle manuals</a> online.</p>

<h4 id="toyotaownersresources6"><a href="http://www.toyota.com/owners/web/pages/resources/maintenance/">Toyota Owners Resources</a></h4>

<p>If you have Toyota vehicles in your fleet, the manufacturer has an easy to use website with good reference guides. The problem, however, is that you have to hand over quite a bit of company/personal information in order to access what you are looking for. </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/513632c8e4b0e2ea417c6355/1362506441619/Toyota%20Maintenance.png" /><h3 id="otherresources">Other Resources</h3>

<p>There are a number of other fantastic tools online that we recommend for helpful maintenance advice.</p>

<h4 id="edmunds1"><a href="http://edmunds.com">Edmunds</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://www.edmunds.com/car-maintenance/guide-page.html">Edmunds.com</a> has become our favorite automotive guide here at Fleetio. This is the one stop shop for finding useful vehicle information. As an example, we looked up a 2010 Ford F-150 with 20,000 miles. The first thing you will notice is that Edmunds includes estimated costs for the services recommended. This will give you a good idea of what to budget going forward. Select the drop-down menu to see what should be scheduled for other intervals.   </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51364331e4b00e99bdc53ca6/1362510643156/Edmunds%20Maintenance%20Schedule.png" /><h4 id="autozoneonline3"><a href="http://www.autozone.com/autozone/repairinfo/carCareAwareMain.jsp">Autozone Online</a></h4>

<p>Although not vehicle-specific, Autozone's Maintenance Interval Guide is a solid quick reference site for setting up your reminders. What we like about this page is the list of parts and the option to plan by month (in case your mileage varies).   </p>

<p><strong>From all of us here at Fleetio - we hope you get the most out of your vehicles and keep it safe.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Fleetio Mobile Version is Open for Beta Testing</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/3/fleetio-mobile-version-is-open-for-beta-testing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">We're excited to announce the mobile optimized version of Fleetio is now available for users to beta test.</p>

<p>A mobile version of Fleetio has been a longstanding request from tons of our users. It's the most popular request in our <a href="https://fleetio.uservoice.com">feedback forum</a>.</p>

<p>And we understand why. Managing a fleet is a mobile job by nature because vehicles are, well, mobile.</p>

<p>So we designed the new mobile version with the "touch" experience in mind from the ground up. The mobile interface is optimized for small screens and "touch-based" navigation instead of using a mouse and keyboard to click around.</p>

<p>Our mobile version isn't an app that you install (at this point at least). Instead we built it using the latest and greatest <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/why">HTML5</a> technology so it will work on most modern smartphones and tablets including iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone and Blackberry devices.</p>

<h4 id="accessingthemobileversion">Accessing the mobile version</h4>

<p>Simple go to <a href="http://m.fleetio.com">m.fleetio.com</a> in any web browser to access the mobile version. Fleetio automatically redirects  most smartphone and tablet devices to the mobile version. You can get back to the full version of Fleetio by clicking the "Full Version" link on the mobile login page.</p>

<h4 id="wewantyourfeedback">We want your feedback</h4>

<p>The new mobile platform is stable and ready to use, but we want your feedback and help finding any small bugs that might still exist.</p>

<p>Our team worked hard on this release and we are really proud of the progress. We'll be refining existing features and adding new features over the next few weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fleetio.com/contact">Get in touch with us</a> through any one of our feedback <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/2013/1/get-social-with-fleetio">channels</a>. We look forward to hearing your thoughts.</p><hr /><div class="image-gallery-wrapper"><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5130cd7de4b0211fabbcd682/1362153477354/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-01%20at%209.29.05%20AM.png.05%20AM.png?format=original" /><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5130cd7fe4b095f36e725562/1362153429868/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-01%20at%209.19.17%20AM.png.17%20AM.png?format=original" /><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5130cd7de4b07fdedd2dd8e8/1362153458497/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-01%20at%209.28.31%20AM.png.31%20AM.png?format=original" /><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5130cd7de4b0973b4dbd0f48/1362153701950/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-01%20at%209.28.57%20AM.png.57%20AM.png?format=original" /><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5130cd7fe4b0211fabbcd685/1362153601329/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-01%20at%209.25.28%20AM.png.28%20AM.png?format=original" /><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5130cd7fe4b07fdedd2dd8f7/1362153638736/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-01%20at%209.24.45%20AM.png.45%20AM.png?format=original" /><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5130cd7ee4b0211fabbcd683/1362153733626/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-01%20at%209.26.09%20AM.png.09%20AM.png?format=original" /><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5130cd7ee4b065c19eb5720f/1362153689849/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-01%20at%209.25.52%20AM.png.52%20AM.png?format=original" /><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5130cd7de4b095f36e72555f/1362153035834/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-01%20at%209.27.02%20AM.png.02%20AM.png?format=original" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Taking Care of Your Tires</title>

It really is a state of mind, where you are constantly checking for conditions and indications that could prove costly to the well being of your fleet. Whether your drivers have a specified checklist each day/week or not, there is still the opportunity to visually inspect vehicles on a regular basis; catching little problems before they turn into big ones.</p>

<p>Tires are a great indicator of issues your vehicle may be experiencing (bad alignment, poor fuel economy, unstable handling, etc.). Likewise, they can also cause a lot of problems when not in the proper condition - posing a safety hazard for both the operator and the company wallet. Here are some quick tire tips to keep your fleet riding smoothly:</p>

<p><strong>Choosing the Right Pressure</strong>
Setting your tires to the wrong pressures can cause irregular wear, cut down on your gas mileage, and significantly affect the overall handling of a vehicle.</p>

<p>The vehicle manufacturer's recommended pressure (found in the owner's manual or via a sticker on the driver's side doorjamb) is what you are looking for. It might be easier to just look at the rating on the tire itself, but that is not the best option. Also, be sure that tires on the same axle are inflated to the same pressure. Otherwise, the car's weight distribution will be askew.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting Based on Conditions</strong>
You have probably heard that the best way to tackle sloppy conditions is by letting some air out of those tires. After all, it worked back in your bicycle riding days! In actuality, lowering the pressures well below the recommended settings will cause <a href="http://www.howacarworks.com/wheels-and-tyres/avoiding-tyre-wear">the tread pattern to close up</a> - essentially leaving the rain/snow/mud with no escape route. That can make things very slippery.</p>

<p>When towing or carrying a maximum load, the general rule of thumb is that you can increase set pressures 4-6 psi. Also, if you intend to do mostly high speed interstate driving, going 3-6 psi over is acceptable. </p>

<p><strong>Checking Pressure Regularly</strong>
It is important to check your tires about once a month for pressure changes and abnormal wear. The best time to do this is when <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/how-to/how-to-check-tire-pressure-and-inflate-tires.html">tires are cold</a> - either first thing in the morning or 30 minutes after driving. </p>

<p>A slight decrease in psi should be expected over the period of a month. However, if you experience a more substantial drop in pressure, there could be a leak.</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring Uneven Tire Wear</strong>
Wear pattern is indicative of how the vehicle rides. If you find that the middle of the tire is worn more than the rest, your pressures are too high. If the edges have more wear, then they are too low. </p>

<p>Also keep an eye out for flatspots, or patches of concentrated scrubbing. This is typically caused by locking up the wheels on braking and can eventually lead to more severe issues, including an unexpected blowout.  </p>

<p>Stay tuned for more helpful tips. Thanks for reading the <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleetio</a> Blog! </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>7 Tips for Successful Fleet Rebranding</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5123ec59e4b08a7615995099/1361308770282/Fleet%20Van%20Wraps.jpg" /><p>Rebranding your fleet may become necessary for a few different reasons. There may be a corporate merger, a new logo or change in products, vision or mission of the company. Whatever the reason, fleet rebranding doesn’t happen all on its own and takes some effort. To guide you through the process, here are 7 tips for successful fleet rebranding.</p>

<p><strong>Project Management</strong></p>

<p>Think of your fleet rebranding efforts as an entire project and utilize good project management skills to gain a successful completion. This means creating a budget, project scope, <a href="http://www.sunrisesigns.com/vehicle-wraps/fleet-wraps/">fleet wraps and graphics vendor</a>, cost, timeframe, etc. Diving right in with no clear plan ensures your fleet rebranding plan will cost more than you thought it would.</p>

<p><strong>Identify Rebranding Need</strong></p>

<p>Clearly determine the need for the rebrand. If it’s because of a new logo design, don’t try to include elements that have nothing to do with the rebrand. These unnecessary elements overwhelm consumers with too much information. If a CEO leaves, for example, and it doesn’t affect the vision and mission of the company, save this information for press releases and instead concentrate only announcing and showcasing the new logo via your fleet.</p>

<p><strong>Design Process</strong></p>

<p>If a new logo must be redesigned or a new company name comes into play due to a merger, you’ll need to work with expert graphic designers on <a href="http://www.sunrisesigns.com/vehicle-wraps/vehicle-wrap-design/">logo creation and typography</a> choices that clearly portray the new brand. Find professionals who can share ideas and changes to everyone on the decision-making process easily and has the expertise to track many changes or requests at once.</p>

<p><strong>Manager Buy-In</strong></p>

<p>This internal process is an essential part of rebranding your fleet. A nationwide or global fleet means you will need to get managers to buy into the new brand, understand the reasoning behind it and be able to consistently support the new brand. Back them up during the first six months or longer if need be; especially the old-fashioned managers who aren’t fond of change.</p>

<p><strong>Internal Stakeholders</strong></p>

<p>A mistake often made in fleet rebranding is not including internal stakeholders. By this we mean those at the corporate level or home office. Include internal stakeholder representatives from all departments and keep the lines of communication open for questions and offer clear answers. Your internal stakeholders will be the support of your off-site managers and how well they buy-in.</p>

<p><strong>Consumers and End Users</strong></p>

<p>A clear plan on brand repositioning, strategy and marketing and advertising delivery of your fleet rebranding efforts must be developed and conveyed to the end user or consumer. If you don’t plan to advertise and market the rebrand, you will lose customers or worse, confuse them ensuring a loss a trust.</p>

<p><strong>Fleet Rebranding Vendor</strong></p>

<p>Choose a vendor that will work as a team, have adequate fleet wrap film inventory materials, industrial printing equipment and manufacturer connections. Find a <a href="http://www.sunrisesigns.com/vehicle-wraps/why-vehicle-wrapping/">fleet vehicle wraps and graphics vendor</a> that employs their own project management style to ensure once the fleet vehicle wrapping process begins, the downtime you face is minimal. Reap the benefits of choosing one fleet graphics and wrap vendor who is also the company behind the design process. This ensures your vehicle wraps, colors, images and typography remains consistent on every fleet vehicle you wrap.</p>

<p>Implementing these seven tips to successful fleet rebranding will ensure a smooth process that keeps everyone involved, internally, externally and above all, your customers.</p>

We know that our software can always be better, so our team is always happy to know how we can make that possible.</p>

<p>Our Dashboard, being the home and starting point for your vehicle management activities, is designed to give you an immediate overview of what is going on in your fleet. This is why we have Service and Renewal Reminder Updates right next to Interactive Charts of your Fuel and Maintenance Costs by month. </p>

<p>One of our users had the bright idea of taking our Fleet Cost Displays to the next level. It made complete sense that users should be able to click on monthly results in the chart and instantly be taken to the report of that information.</p>

<p><strong>As of today, you can now go directly to these reports from the dashboard, thus saving you time and making your user experience even better.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Managing Driver Behavior</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/2/managing-driver-behavior</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51116b34e4b021702b9f0332/1360096055194/Car%20Turnover.jpg" /><p>Since adding our <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/vhm-press-release">Vehicle Health Monitor Integration</a> option to Fleetio, we are finding that our customers have more information to use in their fleet management roles. We want to spotlight this helpful data and provide a clearer picture of how vehicles are being used.</p>

<p>Bad driver behavior can cost your company a lot of money, <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/branding-on-wheels-take-pride-in-your-fleet">portray a poor image</a> and potentially lead to accidents. Conversely, well behaved drivers can cut down on fuel consumption and help your vehicles lasting longer.</p>

<p>VHM reports in Fleetio will display Maximum Acceleration and Deceleration numbers to show you how smooth a driver is on the gas and the brake pedals. Results are shown in G-force (relative to gravity).</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51118113e4b0c73df72b9120/1360101652079/VHM%20Acceleration.png" /><p>So you are looking at the report and you see 0.4 G. Is that good or bad? What, you may ask, is the desired range? Where's the happy medium between a top fuel dragster launching (5.3 G) and a barge pulling into port?</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://blog.creditkarma.com/personal-finance/car/review-progressive-snapshot-discount-rewards-you-for-driving-less-and-braking-softer/">Progressive Insurance</a>, hard braking is defined as greater than 7 feet per second, or approximately 0.3 G. For the average fleet vehicle, you would like to see both the acceleration and deceleration below 0.3 G. A lower number on takeoff is going to produce better gas mileage and show that your driver is more cautious.</p>

<p>Be sure to also check out the miles per gallon numbers and idle time. Across an entire fleet, gallons per day can really add up wreck your budget. Let all of your vehicle operators know that their habits are easily monitored, and you are sure to see a change in behavior. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/510ac619e4b066497fb0ae1a/1359660570258/Fuel%20Card%20Pump%20Small.png" /><div class="alert alert-info">
  This is a guest post brought to you by <strong> <a href="http://fleetcardsusa.com">Fleetcards USA</a>.</strong> We are happy to share their helpful information on the Fleetio blog.
</div><h4 id="howfleetcardswork">How Fleet Cards Work</h4>

<p>A fleet card works like any other credit card, but with the added customization you need to run your fleet. You can customize your card(s) to fit your unique business needs. With a fleet card, you can set purchase controls such as fuel grade, transactions per day and gallons per transaction and can prevent non-fuel purchases and take control of your expenses.</p>

<h4 id="whyyouneedafleetcard">Why You Need a Fleet Card</h4>

<p>Fleet cards will help you manage your company’s fuel and maintenance expenses, save you time and money and give you the controls you need to run your business. You can even earn extra savings. Fleet cards have superior purchase controls, comprehensive detailed reporting showing purchases by driver or vehicle and miles per gallon and nationwide fuel and maintenance locations.</p>

<h4 id="fleetcardcontrols">Fleet Card Controls</h4>

<p>You can restrict purchases to fuel-only or fuel and maintenance and prevent convenience store purchases by limiting cards to “fuel purchases only”. You can track purchases by driver and or vehicle, and limit purchases, require driver or vehicle codes for every purchase to minimize fraud, and set spending and usage limits for each card by day, week or cycle.</p>

<h4 id="fleetcardreporting">Fleet Card Reporting</h4>

<p>A fleet card offers enhanced reporting such as enhanced reporting which shows purchases by driver or vehicle and miles per gallon, tracks odometer readings to analyze fuel purchases and usage, generates exception reports that flag unauthorized purchasing, and monitors after hours purchases, daily transactions and daily dollars amounts in real time. You'll get customized reports based on your business needs that you can access your reporting online 24/7.</p>

<h4 id="integrationwithfleetio">Integration with Fleetio</h4>

<p>Data integration provides the fleet manager access to the functionality, reporting and odometer driven alerts of <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleetio</a> without having to manually rekey fuel purchase and odometer information. Customers using a <a href="http://www.fleetcardsusa.com/apply1.aspx">participating fleet card</a> for all their fuel purchases will eliminate the time needed to update this information in Fleetio, and can focus more time on managing an efficient fleet operation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Telematics: Why Tracking is in Demand</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/1/telematics-why-tracking-is-in-demand</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/51095f0de4b0fe10b367f6c1/1359568654477/Canadian%20Post%20Vans.jpg" /><p>A recently released report from ABI Research has projected that <a href="http://www.abiresearch.com/press/global-fleet-management-system-revenues-to-exceed-">Global Fleet Management System Revenues will exceed $27 Billion by the year 2018</a>; roughly three times the current yearly revenue for the industry. You might be wondering what could be responsible for such an astronomical shift. There are a variety of reasons, but the simple explanation is that fleet management tools are growing into very powerful and valuable resources for every company size. Telematics are huge part of this.    </p>

<p>Telematics can mean a lot of things, but in the automotive world, it primarily refers to the transfer of information from vehicles to software or a online portal that makes sense of it all. This can be done in real time with GPS tracking, on a fixed interval with cell connectivity, or with a passive system that downloads information in range of an antenna. There are a multitude of approaches, but the intent is the same - gathering valuable data that helps you see your fleet from all angles.</p>

<p>The difference comes from what you can do with this gathered information. When applied appropriately, the numbers and figures that are generated by vehicles (driver behavior, fuel efficiency, idle time, diagnostic information, routes, etc.) can give you the decision making prowess that saves money. In many cases, the ability to track vehicles can also protect your company from massive amounts of liability. </p>

<p>As technology is becoming cheaper and more accessible, the money spent on implementing fleet telematics and software is showing a <a href="http://www.automotive-fleet.com/channel/gps-telematics/article/story/2010/02/commercial-fleets-see-cost-savings-from-telematics.aspx?prestitial=1">more economical payback</a>. What companies spend on asset tracking is chump change compared to costs for fuel, unexpected maintenance and legal fees. The results garnered from using this information can certainly be invaluable, and that is magnified over the size of a fleet.  </p>

<p>At <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleetio</a>, we integrate directly with a <a href="http://provasys.com">passive tracking</a> device that collects data from vehicles (through the OBD-2 port) and downloads directly into our fleet management software. We have already seen evidence of customers reducing costs by cutting down on unnecessary idling and poor driver behavior. This also automates the fleet management process, thus making their job easier. </p>

<p>Why is the fleet management system industry going to grow significantly? Because their products are going to help save a lot of time and money.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Regular vs. Synthetic Oil: Which is Right for Your Fleet?</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/1/regular-vs-synthetic-oil-which-is-right-for-your-fleet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/5102fd54e4b0aca3a6e69410/1359150421603/Draining%20the%20Oil%20Blog.jpg" /><p>There are many hotly debated topics in the automotive world: Ford vs. Chevy, naturally aspirated vs. turbocharged, Gas vs. Diesel vs. <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/my-time-in-a-natural-gas-fleet">Natural Gas</a> vs. Electric vs. Biofuel (whew, that's a mouthful), in addition to the ongoing battle of Regular vs. Synthetic Oil. There are a lot of preconceived notions on either side, so we've done our homework and would like to break it down for you. Knowledge is power, and we want you to be the master of your vehicle fleet.</p>

<h4 id="taleofthetape">Tale of the Tape</h4>

<p>In one corner you have the tried and tested fan favorite - derived from the ground and processed with the latest technology. Across the ring, is the young(er) upstart that originated from chemistry. Of course you have to pick your favorite and stick with it, or else your engine will be utterly confused...or will it? Let's keep going.</p>

<h4 id="round1cost">Round 1: Cost</h4>

<p>So you are standing on the motor aisle at Napa Auto Parts and you see enough options to make your head spin. What is probably going to jump out at you first as the differentiating factor? My money...is on the money. Synthetic oil can cost up to twice as much as the conventional stuff. Chances are, you aren't just buying one quart, so multiply that difference over your entire fleet. </p>

<h4 id="round2longevity">Round 2: Longevity</h4>

<p>There are a lot of variables at play in this round. Since nobody wants to run the risk causing major damage, we are all typically going to play it safe on our oil change intervals. You also have to consider the vehicle itself. </p>

<p>An express lube or oil change outfit wants you to visit as much as possible, so they are going to make you feel guilty at 3,000 miles, regardles. That's why they put that sticker as close to your face as possible. </p>

<p>While the average factory recommended interval of new cars is now approaching 8,000 miles, the synthetic oil makers are willing to stick their neck out further with guarantees beyond that. Mobil 1 is promising <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/car-care/stop-changing-your-oil.html">15,000 miles</a> with their Extended Performance line. </p>

<p>There have been plenty of tests to prove that conventional oils simply break down faster. You can blame organic plant matter (not the dinosaurs) from <a href="http://chemistry.about.com/b/2012/05/23/oil-comes-from-dinosaurs-fact-or-fiction.htm">millions of years ago</a>. Oil originating from a lab is able to be more consistent and formulaic in application. Consequently, the cost difference begins to narrow a bit when there will be more frequent changes - especially when labor and downtime are considered. </p>

<h4 id="round3cleanliness">Round 3: Cleanliness</h4>

<p>When all is said and done, you ultimately want to keep all of the moving parts in your engine in tip top shape. Enough gunky buildup is going to eventually cause issues - the kind that make a quart of oil look like chump change. In the same vein, there is an associated environmental impact when we are talking about the proper use and disposal of oil.</p>

<p>Synthetic has a <a href="http://auto.howstuffworks.com/synthetic-conventional-motor-oil.htm">lower volatility</a> (ease of evaporation), which means that less of it will make its way out the tailpipe. In essence, it should burn a little cleaner than regular oil. Improved engine efficiency is also going to help with MPGs and overall power. </p>

<p>Regardless of which one you choose, however, you should follow <a href="http://www.mobiloil.com/USA-English/MotorOil/Synthetics/Synthetic_Oils_FAQs.aspx">recommended procedures for disposal</a>. Neither should be dumped down the drain, and both can be recycled at the appropriate locations.</p>

<h4 id="thepostfighthugwhataboutmixingthetwo">The post fight hug: What about mixing the two?</h4>

<p>Here's where things get a little confusing. Choices on the motor oil aisle now include an array of blended options. The traits of each will depend on the mixture ratio, but we have covered what each end of the spectrum is contributing.</p>

<p>There has been concern in past years about switching back and forth between the two types, or manually mixing them yourself. For older cars (prior to 1990 or so), this can be a little bit iffy because of the way seals inside the engine respond. New rides, however, should not be affected adversely by switching back and forth. </p>

<h4 id="stillundecided">Still undecided?</h4>

<p>If the fight is too close to call, then you can always play it safe and do what your vehicle manufacturer recommends in the owners manual. Most cars these days come outfitted with an electronic oil monitor that is going to annoy you until it is taken in for service. </p>

<p><strong>Happy Driving!</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Press Release: Fleetio Fleet Management Software Now Optimized with Prova Systems Hardware Integration</title>
      <link>/blog/vhm-press-release</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Fleetio, a web-based fleet management software, now integrates seamlessly with Vehicle Health Monitor Technology manufactured by Prova Systems. By utilizing this hardware, Fleetio users will have valuable information uploaded automatically to their account for an affordable monthly rate.</em></p>

<p><strong>Birmingham, Alabama, January 18, 2013</strong> -- With <a href="http://fleetio.com/vhm">Vehicle Health Monitor (VHM) integration</a>, Fleetio is an even more powerful Fleet Management tool. Relevant and timely vehicle data now uploads automatically to Fleetio, and the information can be accessed from any internet capable device. Utilizing VHM records, Fleet Managers are able to monitor fuel usage, idle time, driver behavior and other important analytics. Regular mileage updates in Fleetio will also activate service reminders and renewals that are vital to keeping a fleet running smoothly.</p>

<p>“Our primary focus is on building software that is both powerful and intuitive. By partnering with Prova Systems, we are able to offer our customers an extremely powerful fleet management solution at a very reasonable price,” said Tony Summerville, CEO of Fleetio.</p>

<p>John Collins, CEO of <a href="http://provasys.com">Prova Systems</a>, added “We are delighted to have our hardware integrate with Fleetio. Tony and his team have built an intuitive interface that will provide their customers with a lot of additional value.”</p>

<p>The Prova Systems VHM is very easy to install. The plug and play OBD-II device works on most light-duty vehicles manufactured after 1996. An indoor or outdoor antenna will download data from the VHM as it passes within range, then will immediately sync to that vehicle record in Fleetio. This is just another way Fleetio is empowering users to be the masters of their fleet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How Fleet Vehicles are Changing: 2014 and Beyond</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/1/fleets-vehicles-are-changing-2014-models-and-beyond</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/510bf0cce4b0f04f316adddc/1359737036839/Ford%20Atlas%20New.jpg" /><p>If you want to know what the future holds for Fleet Vehicles, just spend a moment thinking about what you would like them to be. After all, your needs and desires as a consumer are driving the automotive industry. Major auto manufacturers (and some upstart new arrivals) are listening, and here are some of the big improvements that are coming in the 2014 models and beyond.</p>

<h3 id="fuelefficiency">Fuel Efficiency</h3>

<p>Is it possible to have your cake and eat it too? Can there really be improved fuel efficiency without sacrificing power? You bet! As we are seeing with concept vehicles like the <a href="http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-ford-atlas-concept2658-the-future-37587">Ford Atlas</a>, trucks can sip fuel and still give you enough power to get the job done.</p>

<p>How does this happen? Well, there are a few key advances that are making leaps and bounds as far as efficiency is concerned:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Auto Start-Stop Technology</strong> </br>
If you manage a fleet, you are very aware of how idle time can play a huge role in overall efficiency. With this thought in mind, a handful of trucks and SUVs are now rolling out of the factory with an auto start-stop feature that will turn your car off when it comes to a stop (think gas powered golf cart). Once you apply the accelerator, these vehicles spring back to life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improved Aerodynamics</strong> </br>
Large vehicle manufacturers are taking cues from the little guys with a revamped emphasis on reducing drag. Big and boxy is not helping your MPGs. Some models even come with a <a href="http://www.autospies.com/news/Magna-Explains-How-Active-Grille-Shutters-Work-72738/">nifty device</a> which covers the grill at high speeds, reducing unnecessary airflow into the engine compartment. Pretty soon, you will start seeing this idea played out more on other aero-offending parts of the vehicle. (hint: wheels and undercarriage)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Making the Most out of a Gallon</strong> </br>
Instead of increasing engine displacement and building a bigger block, automakers are looking inward - focusing more on power per cubic inch. Direct injection and turbocharging are becoming the norm. This helps cut down on vehicle weight and can result in an efficiency increase in the neighborhood of 20%.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>

<p>Priority number one for Fleets will always be safety. Since operator error is most often the cause of accidents, automakers are now doing more than ever to assist with driver alertness and visibility. Here are a few features that are doing just that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Rear View Cameras</strong> </br>
When it comes to preventable collisions, none are more frequent than backing accidents. Proactive fleet managers have mandatory safety measures and walkarounds before backing a vehicle, but once a large vehicle with a sizeable blind spot is in motion, surprises can happen. This is why rear-view cameras are becoming more and more prevelant in consumer and fleet vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) has even vowed to make them mandatory...<a href="http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2013/01/nhtsa-backup-camera-ruling-delayed-again.html">eventually</a>. If a backup camera does not come standard on the vehicle you are looking at, then chances are it is an option. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Driver Alerts</strong> </br>
Driver fatigue is the cause of many fatal accidents, and there are plenty of new features that aim to keep you more alert while behind the wheel. Lane Departure warning systems are now optional on a number of vehicles, as are forward-collision warnings. Some models have an indicator light, some produce a beep and others will actually <a href="http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2012/10/102512-vtti-crashavoidance.html">brake for you</a>. These options are less common in base-model fleet vehicles, but are approaching mainstream over the next few years. </p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="outsidethebox">Outside the Box</h3>

<p>There are a few new and noteworthy ideas that showed up at this year's 2013 Detroit Auto Show. Check out several that you should keep an eye on...</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Electric Vehicles Go Big</strong> </br>
EVs as we know it are going to start evolving beyond the city-dwelling passenger vehicle. <a href="http://www.techhive.com/article/2025421/electric-motors-come-to-big-trucks-by-way-of-via.html">VIA Motors</a> debuted a handful of offerings that are making people rethink the concept. Even going as far as promising "the torque of a monster truck with the fuel economy of a Prius." This may sound ambitiously optimistic, and the pricetag may be a little steep, but give the technology a few years and see what happens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ergonomics Become a Priority</strong>    </br>
Automakers are looking beyond comfy interiors, and taking a look at how you use the vehicle from all angles. Truck beds are becoming increasingly more ergonomic, with Ford, as well as GM adding pull-out <a href="http://www.newsday.com/classifieds/cars/detroit-auto-show-five-automaker-trends-emerge-1.4462082">steps that are built into the bumper</a>. After all, what good is form without function?</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="thedownsidetothesefancygadgets">The Downside to These Fancy Gadgets</h3>

<p>I'm not trying to sound overly pessimistic with this thought, but we are quickly approaching the age where routine maintenance is going to be a stretch for anyone but trained specialists. Let's face it - once you start outfitting wheels with <a href="http://www.newsday.com/classifieds/cars/detroit-auto-show-five-automaker-trends-emerge-1.4462082">battery-powered aerodynamic shutters</a>, even rotating tires can become a complex task. You can rest assured, however, that the reliability of vehicles - across the board - <a href="http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/the-most-dependable-cars-20120216-1tacf.html">is improving</a>.</p>

<p>So what is next, you ask? Well, just let the 2014 models sink in for a bit, and then think about what else you want.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New Release: Custom Date Range Picker on Reports and More</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/1/new-release-custom-date-range-picker-on-reports-and-more</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/50edf1a3e4b08fa507c14302/1357771173636/date-range-picker.png" /><p>The Fleetio Reports Module just got a lot more horsepower.</p>

<p>We added a date range picker that allows you to choose custom start &amp; end dates for any report. Now you have even more control when searching your data, giving you better insights into your fleet.</p>

<p>The new date range picker is designed to be simple and intuitive. It includes shortcuts for commonly used date ranges (such as Today, This Month, Last 7 Days, etc.) so you can quickly see information for a certain timeframe.</p>

<p><em>What other "common" date ranges would you like to see?</em> Let us know in the comments area.</p>

<h4 id="filterbyrenewaltypeontherenewalschedulereport">Filter by Renewal Type on the Renewal Schedule Report</h4>

<p>We also added a new search filter on the Renewal Schedule Report.</p>

<p>This lets you limit results to certain renewal types (customizable for each account). For instance, now you can easily generate and print a list of all vehicle registration due dates!</p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/50edf200e4b07ac9a3e2492d/1357771265430/renewal-type-filter.png" />]]></content:encoded>

This helps our team understand what is working well and what we can improve. After all, our goal is to make our customers happy. We also get to hear insights on ways our subscribers optimize their account. </p>

<p>To make the most of your Fleetio experience, it is always a good idea to create continuity in how you name your vehicles and equipment. This will help in navigating your data and give a clearer overall picture. </p>

<p>If you don't already have internal numbers and references to go by, it is worth a few minutes to think about how to best organize all of the information before inputting data. This will make life easier for you and your <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/blog/unlimited-users-yall">unlimited users</a>.</p>

<p>To give you some ideas, here are some suggestions that we have recieved from our customers.</p>

<h3 id="includeallrelevantinformationinthename">Include all relevant information in the name</h3>

<p>Fleetio has some great reporting tools and filters to help you narrow down to specific vehicles, but moving around will be easier if you put high level identifiers in the description. For best results, start with the broader items first.</p>

<h5 id="variablestoconsiderwhennamingvehicles">Variables to consider when naming vehicles</h5>

<ul>
<li>Location and/or department of vehicle</li>
<li>VIN (probably just a portion of the VIN; it's a pretty long string of characters)</li>
<li>License plate</li>
<li>Year</li>
<li>Make</li>
<li>Model</li>
<li>Type of vehicle (e.g. "C" for Car, "TU" for Truck, "TA" for Trailer, etc.)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_classification">Class of car</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_classification">truck</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Example: <strong>Location-Year-Make-Model-Last 4 of VIN</strong> </br>
If you have common shorthand references (ie Alabama="A" or "AL"), then that will make things more concise. Keep it as simple as possible to look at the name and figure out exactly what the vehicle is.</p>

<h3 id="getdescriptive">Get descriptive</h3>

<p>We give you a lot of space for naming a vehicle, so feel free to take advantage of it. A 3 Digit number may be all that you need, but Fleetio can accommodate enough information to make that asset easily identifiable. </p>

<h3 id="beconsistent">Be consistent</h3>

<p>Whatever you decide to do in organizing your Fleetio account, it is always best to be consistent. We encourage you to make Fleet Management a collaborate effort, and having a consistent naming convention will allow everyone to learn the ins and outs faster. </p>

      <title>9 Ways to Save on Fleet Insurance</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/50d1e21de4b05aff8e5c61d8/1355932191168/Truck%20Wreck.jpg" /><div class="alert alert-info">
  This is a guest post by <strong>Sarah Montgomery</strong>, writer for <a href="http://carinsurancequotes.org">carinsurance.org</a>.  We are delighted to have her helpful insights featured on the Fleetio Blog!
</div><p>You've signed up for fleet insurance because it just makes more sense. Cutting costs and reducing risk is as good for your business as it is for the insurance companies, so working to keep your premiums low is a win-win situation. By implementing a few of these tips, you can start saving even more on your premium costs. Also, by securing your property and safeguarding the health of your employees, you can gain the peace of mind that you've done right by your crew.  Let's get started.</p>

<h3 id="1identifyrisks">1. Identify risks.</h3>

<p>Ask your current insurer to analyze your claims history. Working together, you can identify areas for improvement and highlight patterns in your claims history. ou can start saving even more on your premium costs. Also, by securing your property and safeguarding the health of your employees, you can gain the peace of mind that you've done right by your crew.  Let's get started.</p>

<h3 id="2trainyourdrivers">2. Train your drivers.</h3>

<p>It may seem simple, but some fleet managers assume their employees are sufficiently trained. Some insurers offer discounts for training, and some don't. However, driver training should be viewed as a long-term investment that will work to reduce your claims, and will ultimately reduce your premiums.</p>

<h3 id="3beselectiveaboutnewhires">3. Be selective about new hires.</h3>

<p>Young drivers between the ages of 17 and 20 are more likely to make an insurance claim than other driver. Not only are these claims more common; they're more expensive. Premiums are generally lower for drivers who are at least 25 years-old with two years of experience. You may also want to run a background check on your drivers to eliminate anyone with major flags on their driving records.</p>

<h3 id="4considersafetyfromallangles">4. Consider safety from all angles.</h3>

<p>When one of your vehicles is involved in an accident, your bottom line takes a punch. But what's harder to handle is one of your drivers is seriously injured. Protecting your people is a big part of keeping your insurance premiums low. You can evidence your commitment to safety in little ways: airbags in the front, back and sides of the vehicle; anti-lock brakes; padded dashboards; and laminate windshields. In addition to adding safety features to vehicles, companies that hold regular safety meetings are often offered a discount. Let your employees know you're serious about safety, and your insurance company will reward you.</p>

<h3 id="5installcameras">5. Install cameras.</h3>

<p>Footage from cameras can be used to defend your company against fraudulent claims and can put at-fault claims to rest. Camera technology can also be used as an alert system to keep drivers from backing into objects.</p>

<h3 id="6payattentiontothedetails">6. Pay attention to the details.</h3>

<p>Never sign off on your policy renewal without an in-depth read over. You never know when someone has tried to slip in an extra without your knowledge. You'd be surprised how many fees your can avoid by reading each line and putting your foot down against unnecessary add-ons. Keep track of your claims so that at the end of the term, you can cut any features you haven't used.</p>

<h3 id="7secureyourvehicle">7. Secure your vehicle.</h3>

<p>You will most likely be offered a premium reduction if you equip each vehicle in your fleet with a GPS tracker. If it's stolen, you can lock onto the location instantly, saving yourself a whole lot of heartache and hassle.</p>

<h3 id="8usetelematics">8. Use telematics.</h3>

<p>Drivers can use telematic systems to communicate and map out directions. In addition to these hands-free capabilities, telematics can be used to send information directly to insurance companies, providing strong incentive for your drivers to follow the speed limit.</p>

<h3 id="9compareratesandalwaysaskformore">9. Compare rates and always ask for more.</h3>

<p>Use a broker or an insurance comparison site to compare prices of different companies. When it comes to discounts, it never hurts to ask. Some companies will provide discounts to established companies – operating under the assumption that companies that have been in business longer will produce fewer claims. Also, companies that use fleet management software may be offered a discount. Don't rely on your insurance agent to provide saving tactics. You should be the first to open up the table for negotiations. Remember, it never hurts to ask.</p>

      <title>7 Signs You Need to Visit a Mechanic</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/12/7-signs-you-need-to-visit-a-mechanic</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/50bf7897e4b07649f8e83be7/1354725528316/Broken%20Down%20Car%20Blog.jpg" /><div class="alert alert-info">
  This is a guest post by <strong>Bill Muffareh</strong>, owner of the <a href="http://www.bwservicecenter.com/" title="San Francisco Auto Repair">B&amp;W Service Center in San Francisco</a>. Bill has been in the vehicle maintenance industry for over 30 years. His B&amp;W Service Center is a trustworthy, neighborly and professional San Francisco auto repair, maintenance and service center dedicated to taking care of their customers with state-of-the-art auto repair technology allowing them to identify nearly any automotive problem on nearly any vehicle.
</div><p>Imagine you are cruising down the highway without a care in the world. The open road is refreshing and the miles fly by. Maybe your Check Engine light comes on, but that’s just a fluke. It will turn off on its own eventually. Then your brakes start to squeak, but that’s nothing to be concerned about (it’s really not that loud, just turn on the radio). You notice your steering wheel isn’t turning as easily as before, but that’s ok because the road is mostly straight anyway. </p>

<p>Then suddenly you’re on the side of the road and your hood is smoking.  What seemed like a few small issues has now turned into an expensive and inconvenient repair.</p>

<p>The key to avoiding this situation is to pay attention to the little things. As we usually recommend to all of our customers here in <a href="http://www.bwservicecenter.com/">our San Francisco auto repair</a> shop, here are seven signs indicating that your vehicle requires a trip to the mechanic:</p>

<ol>
<li>Decrease in Gas Mileage – A sudden decrease in mileage means something is not functioning properly. This could be caused by anything from low oil levels to a gas leak. </li>
<li>Shaking – Some vibrations in your car is normal. Excessive and unceasing shaking is not. This could be a due to defective wheel alignment, which can cause further damage if left unfixed. </li>
<li>Noisy Steering Wheel – Squealing, grinding or stiffness when turning the steering wheel are all signs of a problem. The most likely cause is low power steering fluid level. </li>
<li>Leaking Fluids – All liquids should remain inside the vehicle. If you see stains under your car, something is wrong. </li>
<li>Noisy Brakes – If you notice a loud grinding noise when you step on the brake, head straight to the mechanic. This usually means you need new break pads.</li>
<li>Slow Changing Gears – When changing gears, the response from your vehicle should be immediate. A pause between shifting could mean issues with the transmission. An abrupt jerk when shifting from park to drive also indicates a problem with the transmission. </li>
<li>Exhaust Emissions – A pungent, egg-like smell coming from the exhaust could indicate a dirty or clogged catalytic converter. If black smoke is being emitted, your O2 sensor is probably clogged. </li>
</ol>

<p>Don’t delay, or these minor inconveniences may lead to major problems down the road.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>My Time in a Natural Gas Fleet</title>
      <link>/blog/my-time-in-a-natural-gas-fleet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/50b91e39e4b03f520500afb8/1354309177849/honda-civic-cng.jpg" /><p>Before joining the Team at <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleetio</a>, I spent a number of years working with a company that was in the process of converting their entire fleet over to natural gas.  The scope was huge. Simultaneously, they were building new stations around the state, replacing hundreds of vehicles, and adding conversion kits to others.  </p>

<p>As someone involved with selling our customers on the idea, I was lucky enough to be on the front end of this change.  My Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Honda Civic was essentially a rolling billboard - one that still had to fit into my daily routine.  Since I have moved on and am no longer obligated to be biased on the subject, I wanted to offer up my experience and takeaways for anyone considering switching their fleet to CNG.  </p>

<p><strong>First Impressions</strong></p>

<p>One of the inescapable truths about Compressed Natural Gas, is that it is in fact a gas (shocking revelation, I know).  Volumetrically speaking, it takes up a lot more space than gasoline.  This was painfully obvious when I opened the trunk of my Civic for the first time.  The larger fuel cell (from the factory) monopolized enough space to where a small golf bag (handy in a sales roll) pretty much filled it to capacity.    </p>

<p>Fueling up for the first time was a bit of an adventure.  When you are dealing with pressures in the neighborhood of 3600 psi, there are a few more safety measures than you might find at a gasoline pump.  The car had a steel nozzle that the the hose would securely clamp onto before pushing any gas.  That being said, once I went through the routine a few times, a CNG fill up wouldn't take any longer than a regular one.</p>

<p>Aside from the space restrictions and fueling, there was really no way to know that you were operating a CNG vehicle.  The engine sounded the same.  Throttle response was close enough to not be differentiable.  An aside: My front brake rotors were warped almost immediately (as they were with many of my coworkers who had Civics).  My best engineering guess at the root of this problem is either 1. Honda doesn't design that model for the hills we have here in Birmingham, or 2. The lower rear weight of the car with a natural gas cell (vs. a liquid tank) causes the car to pitch forward more under heavy braking.  So, in essence, the driving experience was pretty much the same.</p>

<p><strong>Fitting Into the Daily Routine</strong></p>

<p>Unlike some fleet vehicles, I was allowed to take my Honda home and use it for personal driving.  This, more so than the business end, highlighted the struggles of making a switch to CNG.  If you have a central location that vehicles return to daily, then installing a pump or <a href="http://ngvsolutions-px.rtrk.com/index.php/compressors">time-fill compressors</a> could solve a lot of your availability issues. </p>

<p>One of my coworkers had a pump installed at his house that tapped into an existing natural gas line.  His car would fill up overnight, and unless he was driving more than 250 miles (yep, that's how far you can go on a tank) in a day, he never had visit a station.  My territory was pretty far reaching, so there were quite a few times where I was either sweating it out going 50 mph the whole way (air conditioning off) or getting creative with my planned route.</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance</strong></p>

<p>All you need to know about the maintenance of a CNG vehicle can be summed up in this story:</p>

<p>I was told initially that, due to the lack of impurities in the fuel, I could go longer between oil changes.  This being said, at 6,0000 miles I was tired of my Civic beeping at me incessantly - insisting daily that the oil life was now at zero percent.</p>

<p>So I stopped by Express Oil Change during lunch one day.  As the attendant approached and asked for my current mileage, I was quickly the object of his judgement.  He politely reminded me that I should get my oil changed more frequently than as evidenced in this first interval.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, as I'm still being scowled at by the guy up top, a mechanic down below makes a very loud comment about how my exiting oil is in remarkable shape.  "You could have gone a lot further than this" he yells from out of my site range.  This is when I conveniently made a "hmm...is that so?" face in the direction of my now shamed attendant. </p>

<p>You get the point - being a cleaner burning fuel means that CNG has some obvious maintenance benefits when compared to gasoline.  I have been told (no personal proof of this, but it is believable) that the engine life can be up to twice as long in a dedicated natural gas powered vehicle.  Obviously, as a fleet manager, this is going to help your bottom line with regards to ongoing expenses, but...</p>

<p><strong>Costs</strong></p>

<p>If you are starting to get excited about buying a natural gas fleet of your very own, here's where things gets complicated: Up front costs.  Due to the supply-and-demand nature of the auto industry, going CNG is going to run you a little more than the regular gasoline version.  To give you an idea, my no frills Honda Civic GX was stickered at $26,000 from the lot.  The gasoline version was closer to $20,000.  For the foreseeable future, this upcharge will be incrementally similar for any CNG vehicle you buy.  Our company did receive a government incentive to knock about $4,000 off the total.  Trying to keep up with what incentives are still around is tough, so do your homework before assuming any currently exist.</p>

<p>Contrary to the up front sticker shock, pump prices were relatively refreshing.  As I write this, there are a <a href="http://www.cngprices.com/station_map.php">number of stations</a> in our area (Southeast US) that are priced $1.00 to $1.50 cheaper per gallon equivalent (matching mmbtu content) cheaper than gasoline.  Some states are higher than this, and some are much, much lower.  The average price in Utah, for instance, currently hovers around $1.50 per gallon equivalent.  That could be  a pretty quick payback if you are driving a lot of miles every day.</p>

<p>One annoying thing to add is that there are states requiring special permitting in order to own/operate a compressed gas vehicle (in Alabama, this applies to propane as well).  The process is a bit archaic and they charge an extra fee for a sticker that takes up way too much of one's windshield, but it's the law around here.  Check on your local regs just to be sure.</p>

<p><strong>The Big Picture</strong></p>

<p>When I gave up my company car back in August, it was with mixed emotions.  For two years, my mode of transportation was a conversation piece on wheels.  People would stop me quite often to ask questions about the car, and it always garnered a positive attitude from folks.  In a way, I think the idea that there are working alternatives to gasoline gives people hope.</p>

<p>In reality, I had to purchase a personal vehicle immediately.  This is where I exposed the biggest issue fighting the CNG movement: availability.  Whether you are trying to find a vehicle (in my case, used and reasonably priced), or a place to fill up (only one public station near my daily commute), the options are few and far between.  I went back to a gasoline-powered car.</p>

<p>If you are brazen enough to build your own large-scale compressor station to fill vehicles quickly, the likely price tag is half a million dollars (US) or more.  Investors need vehicles on the road to prove that that building out the necessary stations is a wise decision.  On the other end, automakers aren't going to crank out millions of new CNG models if there are few places to fill them up.  </p>

<p>Plenty of folks out there remember when CNG was all the rage.  My previous employer has ripped out more than one fueling station in the last few decades.  The staying power this time around, however, is powered by a natural gas supply that has never been seen before.  Shale gas has changed the big picture entirely.</p>

<p>With the relative security of price (very few offshore natural gas rigs left) and massive reserves, the new CNG Movement has serious promise.  As with anything on this scale, however, the early adopters will have to pave the way for widespread growth.  In many cases, these are going to be companies with predictable routes, tighter emissions regulations and easy access.  My previous employer was in the natural gas industry, so it was pretty much a no brainer.</p>

<p>There are some folks who have gotten their toes wet, so to speak, by retrofitting a gasoline vehicle with an additional CNG tank.  This allows for a much greater range and the ability to switch back and forth depending on availability.  This way you could still experience a fuel cost savings.  </p>

<p>What I learned, however, is that people are inherently lazy.  This pricy (at least $4,000) add-on is not going to get utilized nearly as much as one might expect.  If your employee is choosing between the readily available gasoline and an out-of-the-way CNG station, they are going to take the easy route - especially if they aren't paying for the difference.</p>

<p><strong>The Takeaway</strong></p>

<p>Slowly but surely, the CNG market is moving from an "I own one to get that happy feeling" mentality to the "It makes complete dollars and sense" argument.  Price and availability are issues that can easily be resolved with time.  As I write this, equipment for CNG filling stations is in short supply all around the country.  The demand is growing. </p>

<p>Is CNG right for you and your company?  Whether you are planning for today or two years from now, the answer is largely dependent on these key  factors:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Availability - are you in a region where there are existing natural gas stations or abundant pipelines (possibility)?</p></li>
<li><p>Daily Routes - does your fleet travel a predictable local route daily?  Municipals, city transit and related services are a perfect fit.</p></li>
<li><p>Mileage - are you spinning the wheels enough to ensure a quick payback?</p></li>
<li><p>Regulatory Environment - is the federal/state/local government offering up the right incentives and pricing to make CNG a good financial decision for you?</p></li>
</ol>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>As a gear-head (eh... a well-read gear-head) I can attest to the purity of the CNG as a fuel. It's amazing how clean the oil is, well, the whole intake and exhaust system also, compared to a gas burner. The oil starts to get a little molasses colored around 10,000 miles. But I hasten to add, that even though there is a lack of visible impurity, the viscosity modifiers and emulsifiers and all the other little magic stuff in the oil that makes is behave like it should at different temperatures may go beyond their design parameters. That's just a concern of mine. I haven't been able to find any viable source to confirm or deny that.  But on the other hand, keeping the recommended maintenance intervals on a CNG powered powerplant, operating under cleaner conditions, would most likely lead the way to an significantly longer service life.</p><p>Just my two cents.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Why Software as a Service?</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/why-software-as-a-service</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may have already noticed, <a href="http://Fleetio.com" title="Fleetio Fleet Management Software">Fleetio</a> is different from most of the Fleet Management Software products out there. &nbsp;We like it that way. &nbsp;With us, you don't have to contact a sales rep and wait for a box of software to arrive in the mail. &nbsp;No download is required. &nbsp;In 30 seconds or less, you can start using your full-access account at no charge. &nbsp;We host Fleetio for you and update it automatically, utilizing what is known as a Software as a Service (SaaS) Model.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me44tkiUgU1qkbt2c.png" /></p>

<p>There are plenty of benefits to going with a SaaS product. &nbsp;In addition to what has been mentioned above, you do not have to worry about the massive amounts of hardware that typically accompanies hosting your own software. &nbsp;As we highlighted in a <a href="http://blog.fleetio.com/post/33708710091/switching-to-the-cloud-a-success-story" title="Bytecomm Cloud-Based Conversion">previous article</a>, one of our customers was able to clear out an entire room by going to online-only software. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We chose to build Fleetio on a SaaS model because it is an excellent fit for the Fleet Industry and Fleet Managers in their day-to-day routine. &nbsp;Our customers love that whether they are on an iPad out in the field or sitting behind a desk all day, Fleetio can be accessed from any major web browser. &nbsp;Because of this, and our policy of allowing unlimited users on all paid accounts, Fleet Management can also be collaborative. &nbsp;Employees with a variety of roles can contribute with full or restricted account access.</p>

<p>Lastly, we think that software should be constantly evolving. &nbsp;The roll of Managing Vehicles and Equipment will not be the same today as it is in a few years, so why should your tools remain static? &nbsp;In the midst of tighter regulations or changing technology, we intend for Fleetio to be well positioned, with constant updates included at no extra charge to existing users.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Thanksgiving Drive</title>
      <link>/blog/the-thanksgiving-drive</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/507ed8a6e4b0c61b499d1900/50b3c671e4b04f0afb50d6ba/50b3eb21e4b0ee338c8bd368/1353968418709/Thanksgiving%20Turkey.jpg" /><p>Happy Thanksgiving week from the team here at <a href="http://fleetio.com" title="Fleetio Fleet Management Software">Fleetio</a>! &nbsp;We are all doing our best to exercise and skimp on lunch in order to prepare ourselves for the delicious meals that lie ahead. &nbsp;We are also busy preparing our cars for a bit of travelling so that we assuredly reach our tasty destinations.</p><p>In hopes that you will also have a safe and happy Thanksgiving, here are a few helpful tips to prepare your family fleet for the holidays:</p><p><strong>1. Tire Pressure</strong></p><p>As our buddy Tess <a href="http://blog.fleetio.com/post/34101359557/signs-that-you-need-alignment" title="Vehicle Alignment and Maintenance">wrote about</a>, the alignment of your vehicle is ground zero for many potential issues. &nbsp;Your tires are a big part of ensuring proper alignment. &nbsp;Open up the driver’s side door and see what pressures the manufacturer recommends. &nbsp;This will not only keep your car on the straight and narrow, but keeping them properly inflated will also ensure that you aren’t losing valuable gas mileage on the way to Grandma’s.</p><p><strong>2. Fluid Levels</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a master mechanic to pull out your car’s dipstick and check the oil level. &nbsp;Before a long haul, it is worth the peace of mind to know your engine is protected from the wear and tear you are about to give it. &nbsp;Same goes for the radiator fluid, which helps keep the water unfrozen this time of year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Lights</strong></p><p>In our part of the world, daylight hours are quickly being reduced to a minimum. &nbsp;Most of our driving is taking place in the darkness. &nbsp;Before heading off for a few hundred miles, tell Junior to get out of the car and check all of your lights and turn signals.</p><p><strong>4. Emergency Supplies</strong></p><p>You would always rather be safe than sorry! &nbsp;That’s why it is always a good idea to throw some blankets, gloves and a flashlight in the trunk. &nbsp;</p><p>All the best to you and yours!</p><p>-The Team at Fleetio</p><p>Image copyright martha_chapa95 via flickr<a href="#" data-link-type="external"></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

</blockquote><p>Vehicles are the backbone of Kid One’s mission. &nbsp;Understandably, we are quite proud that they use Fleetio to track maintenance and ensure that costs are closely monitored. &nbsp;Money lost from an expensive repair, and the downtime suffered as a result, inhibit their ability to get their clients to the medical care they are in need of. &nbsp;So yeah, they take their Fleet Management Software very seriously. &nbsp;The same can be said about the many other nonprofit customers around the world that currently use Fleetio.</p><h3>Nonprofit Discount</h3><p>Because of what they do for all of us, <strong>we are pleased to offer Charitable Organizations a 10% discount on their monthly subscription</strong>. &nbsp;It is our way of showing appreciation for helping the greater good. &nbsp;Please feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@fleetio.com" title="Fleetio Contact">contact us</a> if you would like to learn more. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Fleetio &amp; Southpace Properties</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, on the <a href="http://fleetio.com" title="Fleetio Fleet Management Software" target="_blank">Fleetio</a> Blog, we are excited to spotlight one of our customers and and how they have been using Fleetio to optimize their stable of vehicles.</p><p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdduy7kJdr1qkbt2c.jpg"></p><p><a href="http://southpace.com" title="Southpace Property Management" target="_blank">Southpace Properties, LLC</a> is the largest independently owned commercial real estate firm in the state of Alabama. &nbsp;They are based in Birmingham, and have played a key role in the revitalization of the downtown area.</p><p>Southpace buys, sells, leases, develops, manages and invests for their clients in all types of commercial real estate including office, land, industrial, retail, warehouse and special purpose properties. &nbsp;On any given day, a number of their employees are utilizing vans or trucks to attend to these properties.&nbsp;</p><p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdduyqn3SL1qkbt2c.png"></p><p>When we first spoke to Southpace, they were using <a href="http://www.trackersystems.net/" title="Tracker Systems GPS" target="_blank">GPS tracking</a> for dispatch and routing of vehicles. &nbsp;Preventative maintenance as well as costs were being managed through spreadsheets or physical files. &nbsp;Drivers were largely responsible for scheduling routine service. &nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p>Before Fleetio my drivers went in for the typical oil change and tire rotation and balance whenever they could find the time in their schedule. This could mean they were 4,000+ miles over the scheduled maintenance. Now that I have Fleetio, it is so easy to see who has an upcoming service especially since I receive an email as a reminder. Fleetio also makes it so easy to keep up with all the documentation for each service record. It has worked beautifully so far. <strong>-Heather Turner, Southpace</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>After weathering a large repair bill and excessive downtime for one of their vans, they saw a need for a comprehensive fleet management product. &nbsp;We were happy to help them consolidate data and put in place service reminders that would keep both drivers and management updated on scheduled maintenance.</p><p>They know that we are a quick phone call, web chat, or email away.</p><blockquote>
<p>As far as Fleetio’s customer service goes they have been top notch. During the set up process and getting acquainted with the system I had several questions and they responded almost immediately. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>-Heather Turner</strong></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cars and trucks are an essential part of our daily routine. &nbsp;Maybe that’s why purchasing an automobile can be such a difficult experience. &nbsp;If you are going to spend that much money, wouldn’t you like to be assured that you are making the right decision?</p><p>But that, as you know, is quite a challenge. &nbsp;In a few hours, under the supervision of overzealous salesmen, are you really going to collect enough information to answer every possible reservation? &nbsp;Probably not.</p><p>The Ford Taurus commercials of a year ago were, in essence, an attempt to ease some of the concerns that previous models raised. &nbsp;Don’t think the new version has enough power? &nbsp;Oh, well here’s some footage of Carl Edwards scaring the bejesus&nbsp;out of people while he power slides the car around a road course. &nbsp;</p><p>On that same vein, wouldn’t it be great to have a live visual and actual proof of everything your potential car could do? &nbsp;While Carl is giving hair raising ride-alongs to highlight performance, you could get a peek at Mark Martin’s odometer as he passes the 100,000 mile mark with a model right off the show room floor. &nbsp;Meanwhile, Tony Stewart is tasked with validating the stickered gas mileage - AC blasting and loaded down with a car of screaming children. &nbsp;Surely he would enjoy that!</p><p>Here at <a href="http://fleetio.com" title="Fleetio Fleet Management Software" target="_blank">Fleetio</a>, we are very aware that your subscription to our service is another important decision to make. &nbsp;That’s why we now offer <a href="http://blog.fleetio.com/post/35142538512/try-us-on-for-size" title="Free Trial Fleet Management Software">free trial accounts</a> of any size, with an unlimited users - so you can give your boss and coworkers a chance to evaluate our Fleet Management system. &nbsp;</p><p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md8dvpLd551qkbt2c.png"></p><p>We also want you to know that our team is happy to give a full demo upon request. &nbsp;Not only will you get to see all that Fleetio can do, but you also get to ask one on one questions with one of our outstanding team members. &nbsp;<strong>Email us: hello@Fleetio.com to set up your demo!</strong></p><p><em>image copyright Ford Motor Company</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vehicle Maintenance may receive a lot of emphasis around these parts, but we wanted to let you know that&nbsp;<a href="http://fleetio.com" title="Fleetio Equipment Management Software">Fleetio</a>&nbsp;is also handy with all of your equipment. &nbsp;We understand that being Fleet Manager can encompass much more than keeping the wheels rolling. &nbsp;That’s why we have designed our product to work with much more than simply cars and trucks.&nbsp;</p><p>Customers use our software to log inspections and maintenance on a variety of assets. &nbsp;Emergency Response teams keep up with regular safety tests on ladders, hoses, and other essential resources. &nbsp;Transport companies store valuable information about their trailers. &nbsp;Our Municipal folks might have to occasionally clear a road (especially this time of year), so it is good to know that Fleetio has ensured regular maintenance on that plow.</p><p>Rather than tracking in miles or kilometers, you can tailor equipment usage to hours. &nbsp;Service reminders can be set up for certain time intervals, so you are guaranteed to get an email when that critical service or inspection is due.&nbsp;</p><p>You get the picture. &nbsp;Our software is built to help you make the most of vehicles as well as your other valuable assets. &nbsp;There may be a car on our logo, but we can help you with much more!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Signs that You Need Alignment</title>
      <link>/blog/signs-that-you-need-alignment</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><em><strong><span class="s1">Today, the team here at <a href="http://fleetio.com" title="Fleetio Fleet Management Software">Fleetio </a>is delighted to feature a guest post by Tess Winningham, CEO of <a href="http://www.quicktrickalignment.com/" title="Quick Trick Alignment Solution">Alignment Simple Solutions, LLC</a>.&nbsp; She has a great product and is a formidable expert on the subject of vehicle alignment. &nbsp;</span></strong></em></p><p class="p1"><em><strong><span class="s1">Take it away, Tess!</span></strong></em></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A car’s alignment refers to how the angles of the wheels are adjusted. When a mechanic performs an alignment, he adjusts the angle of the wheels to the manufacturer’s specification or the range allowed. Knowing when you need an alignment may not be obvious, but it is an important part of vehicle maintenance. Bad alignment can result in premature tire wear as well as steering problems.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are the Most Obvious Signs:</span></p><p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Pulling To One Side</span></strong></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your car is drifting to the center of the road or towards the shoulder, then you could have an alignment problem. You may find yourself continually applying pressure to the wheel to keep the car moving straight. The reason a car pulls to one side is usually due to the camber of the wheels. Camber refers to the angle at which the wheels are lined up with the road.&nbsp; The slightest wrong adjustment in camber will cause the car to veer to one side or the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Wandering</span></strong></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">An inadequately aligned car may pull to one side because of camber, it can also have other steering problems because of caster, or the angle of the steering pivot. When viewed from the side, the caster may cause the steering pivot to lean back or forward.&nbsp; This makes steering in a straight line a constant battle. If it is positioned too far forward, or positive, it could make the steering jerky and too stiff.</span></p><p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Tire Wear</span></strong></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most obvious symptoms of an incorrect alignment is tire wear.&nbsp; When the tires are misaligned, with regard to toe-in or camber, it causes areas of the tire to be overused and results in a shorter tire life.&nbsp; Excessively worn out treads on the outside of a tire can mean the camber is too positive, or there is too much toe-in. Inside wear indicates the opposite alignment problem with possible negative camber and/or misaligned toe out.</span></p><p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Common Misconceptions on Wheel Alignment</span></strong></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A common misconception about poor alignment is that it causes shaking while you drive. Shaking or vibration, while driving, is often caused by a worn-out tire that is out of round, or unbalanced tires. Worn tires may initially be a result of an alignment problem, but the shaking itself is because of the condition of the tires, not the alignment itself. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1"><em><strong>Follow Tess and Alignment Simple Solutions:</strong> </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mrquicktrick" title="Mr Quick Trick Twitter">@MrQuickTrick</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/AlignmentSimpleSolutions" title="Alignment Simple Solutions Facebook">AlignmentSimpleSolutions</a>, <a href="http://mrquicktrick.blogspot.com" title="Mr Quick Trick Blog"></a><a href="http://mrquicktrick.blogspot.com">http://mrquicktrick.blogspot.com</a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Switching To the Cloud: A Success Story</title>
      <link>/blog/switching-to-the-cloud-a-success-story</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>How Cloud Services Made Bytecomm a More Efficient Company</h3><p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbzq44V5hi1qkbt2c.png"></p><p>At <a href="http://fleetio.com" title="Fleetio Fleet Management Software">Fleetio</a>, we love to hear stories from happy customers. &nbsp;It makes us feel quite warm and fuzzy to know that our software can make a positive impact on the way companies do business. &nbsp;If we can save people time, money and stress, then we have accomplished what we set out to do with Fleetio. &nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.bytecomm.com.au/" title="Bytecomm">Bytecomm</a>, of Queensland, Australia, is one of the stories we love to share.</p><p>Bytecomm is a niche telecommunications tech company that provides a variety of on-site solutions for the communications industry. &nbsp;Back in January of 2012, Bytecomm started converting all their primary business functions to cloud-based services. &nbsp;Like many companies, their employees are constantly on the move. &nbsp;They needed software solutions that could be accessible from anywhere. &nbsp;</p><p>To quote Peter Head, Manager of Bytecomm, “Our work mainly revolves around getting new equipment to a site, getting it installed and commissioned and cut into the operational network. That typically requires us to travel to reasonably remote areas and the ability to have near real-time access to information has been a real productivity bonus for us.”</p><p>Since January, they have drastically reduced their IT expenses and have a whole new storage room where their servers formerly resided.</p><p>Along with using Fleetio for web-based fleet management, they have adopted Google Apps for Business for email, calendaring and documents, <a href="http://www.xero.com/" title="Xero Accounting Software">Xero</a> for business management/accounting and <a href="http://www.workflowmax.com/" title="Workflow Max">WorkFlowMax</a> for project management. &nbsp;</p><p>With these new user-friendly tools, more of the office staff can easily share the workload. &nbsp;Time dedicated to administrative tasks has been significantly reduced, and their employees can focus on growing the business.&nbsp;</p><p>Bytecomm is a shining example of why we built Fleetio to be cloud-based and intuitive. &nbsp;We are very proud to have them as a customer!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Call this number…” sticker or not, irate drivers will have little reservation in contacting your company if they see drivers exhibiting inappropriate behavior. &nbsp;The company logo on the side is all they need to track you down. &nbsp;Not to mention the negative connotation that will now be associated with your company. &nbsp;</p><p>Minimize bad driver behavior with on-board tracking devices. &nbsp;Whether you have GPS or <a href="http://www.provasys.com/" title="Prova Systems">Vehicle Health Monitors</a>, Active or Passive Systems, when a driver knows that his or her habits are monitored, they are much more likely to behave appropriately behind the wheel. &nbsp;The same goes for overall efficiency. &nbsp;Tracking vehicles effectively will help reduce fuel consumption, excessive wear on the vehicle, as well as reducing idle time.</p><p><strong>Vehicle Condition</strong></p><p>So it has been a while since your trucks got a good cleaning. &nbsp;Not a big deal, right? &nbsp;Guess again. &nbsp;Potential customers are out on the roads every day forming lasting impressions of your company. &nbsp;What does it say about your business if people can clearly see you don’t take pride in your assets?</p><p><strong>Maintenance</strong></p><p>The same goes for broken down vehicles on the side of the road. &nbsp;Regardless of the product or service, customers want to know with certainty that a company is reliable. &nbsp;Can they count on you be on time? &nbsp;Will this widget last up over the long haul? &nbsp;If it comes down to consideration, that mental image of your truck smoking on the side of the road could make a difference. &nbsp;Keep up with your regularly scheduled maintenance. &nbsp;<a href="http://fleetio.com" title="Fleetio Fleet Management">Fleetio</a> will happily assist with that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>It's All About the Customer</title>
      <link>/blog/its-all-about-the-customer</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Momma told us not to brag, but every now and then, we just can’t help but pass along some of the nice things our customers are saying. &nbsp;If you are considering <a href="http://fleetio.com">Fleetio</a>, we want you to know that there are plenty of companies already on board with us, and they are happy. &nbsp;Maybe that is why we have over a 99% retention rate.</p><p>One of our customers, <a href="http://www.newburycouriers.com/">Newbury Couriers</a>, is a delivery company in the UK. &nbsp;Here is what they had to say:</p><blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<span>I found Fleetio scouring the web in search of a fleet management system with the assistance of Google to aide us in managing our growing fleet. I was impressed with Fleetio’s approach and enthusiasm to fleet management and their customers and decided to give it try with our vans as it was free.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>As the system seemed simple to use and could be tailored to our needs it was making the vans easier to manage so we decided to roll it out to the rest of our fleet and monitor how we got on. Because Fleetio is on a month by month basis and there is no long term contract it made the decision easier knowing we weren’t tied down.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I have been impressed with the personal service we have received from Fleetio, especially as we are across the pond from you! Your openness to suggestion and tailoring of the system to our needs is excellent and I am happy to be using Fleetio.</span></p>
</blockquote><p>Thanks to Chris Burton for the kind words!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New Fuel Entry Updates and More</title>
      <link>/blog/fuel-management-updates</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re happy to announce some great updates, mostly pertaining to fuel management in Fleetio.</p><ul><li>You can now <strong>save notes and comments for Fuel Entries</strong>, just like on Service Entries. This is great when you want to capture additional information about a particular fuel-up.<br><br><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9unbmPchY1qkbt2c.png"><br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>We <strong>added a reference field for Fuel Entries</strong> as well. Now you can record things like invoice numbers or transaction codes for a fuel-up and easily find it later.</li>
<li><strong>Analytical fuel trends</strong> are now displayed in Fleetio. These fuel management analytics help you compare a specific fuel entry’s details to the average amounts for a vehicle (e.g. fuel economy for a specific fuel up compared to the average).<br><br><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9un34knx11qkbt2c.png"><br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>We <strong>added an advanced mode to the Vehicle List and Vehicle Details Reports</strong>, which allows you to search by more fields including VIN and license plate.<br><br><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9un7naMYR1qkbt2c.png"><br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>License plate information</strong> now appears on the Vehicle List Report.</li>
<li>We added a <strong>“Save and Add Another” button to the Vehicle form</strong> so you can quickly input multiple fleet vehicles into Fleetio.</li>
</ul><p><strong>All of these ideas came directly from customers</strong>, so keep the feedback coming. We’re listening!</p><p><a href="https://secure.fleetio.com/login">Log in</a> and check out the new updates now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Introducing Better User Permissions</title>
      <link>/blog/introducing-better-user-permissions</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fleetio is changing the way organizations manage their fleet. One of the most important concepts we introduced is the ability to share fleet management knowledge and responsibilities across the organization. Today we’re making that even easier.</p><h3>Meet the new user roles &amp; permissions</h3><p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8gayxmDwI1qkbt2c.png"></p><p>Fleetio’s user permission system is centered around roles. These roles are like “buckets” that help you control how your company’s users and drivers access Fleetio. The roles fall into three different categories: Limited Access, Limited Management and Full Access.</p><h4>Limited Access</h4><p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8gb2dblY11qkbt2c.png"></p><p>Users with the “Notifications” role cannot actually log into Fleetio to view or manipulate any data for an account. These users can only receive reminder notification emails from service or renewal reminders. This is useful in companies where you don’t want drivers to access the fleet management system, but you do want to keep them up to date when maintenance is due or licenses are up for renewal.</p><p>“Viewer” role users can log into Fleetio and view all the vehicle information for the account, but they can’t actually manipulate any data. This is really handy for stakeholders in your organization that need to look at fleet data, but don’t need to be updating any information.&nbsp;These users are also prevented from accessing the Account Settings area.&nbsp;</p><h4>Limited Management</h4><p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8gb63G3Fb1qkbt2c.png"></p><p>“Manager” users can manage vehicle-related information, but only for certain vehicles and/or locations. The Manager role makes Fleetio really unique when it comes to user access and delegation of&nbsp;responsibilities. This is huge for helping organizations share fleet management duties across multiple people while reducing the chance of mistakes.</p><p>Let’s say you want your drivers to update information for their vehicle, but not any of the other vehicles in the fleet. Just assign them manager access to their assigned automobile and they will be able to update mileage, enter service and fuel records, track maintenance and more - but only for their car or truck. If they access other vehicle records in Fleetio, they will only be able to view information and not actually update anything.</p><p>What if you have people in your company who need to be able to manage all the vehicles at their location but not anywhere else? This is a common issue for distributed fleets with lots of locations. We’ve made it simple to assign one or more locations to a Manager user. They’ll be able to manage all the vehicles at the location, but not any other locations. As soon as you assign a vehicle to that location, the user will be able to manage it - and vice versa - if you remove vehicle from a location in Fleetio the user will no longer be able to manage its information.</p><p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8gb9wooqR1qkbt2c.png"></p><p><strong>So what does “manage” mean?</strong> Users with manager rights can add, edit and delete information for any vehicle they manage such as odometer/mileage, vehicle profile &amp; purchase information, maintenance records &amp; service reminders, notes &amp; documents, fuel expenses and more.</p><h4>Full Access</h4><p>“Admin” users will be able to manage all fleet vehicles and equipment for an account. Additionally, there are two special permissions that you can enable per Admin user: Manage Account Settings and Manage Other Users.</p><p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8gbc4ri3M1qkbt2c.png"></p><p>Admin users with the “Manage Account Settings” permission will be able to add, edit and delete Locations, Service Types, Vehicle Types and Vehicle Statuses. Additionally, those with the “Manage Other Users” permission will be able to add &amp; edit users of the account, except for the Owner user and their own user account.</p><p>The Owner user (the person who created the account) will have full reign of the account, including the ability to manage the subscription and billing information. This is exactly how it worked already in Fleetio.</p><h3>What’s next for user roles?</h3><p>We tried to strike a balance between flexibility and user friendliness with this update to user roles &amp; permissions. Of course we can always make things more granular but at the potential cost of making it too complicated. After all, customers tell us it’s the simplicity and wonderful user experience that they love most about Fleetio.</p><p>Give it a shot and let us know what you think. We look forward to hearing your feedback and usage scenarios.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Pardon the Interruption: Jul 23rd Downtime Postmortem</title>
      <link>/blog/pardon-the-interruption-jul-23rd-downtime-postmortem</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early this morning (U.S. time) Fleetio was inaccessible for almost 5 hours. While it was nothing wrong with our software or servers, it still caused our service to be unavailable for an extended amount of time. That&#8217;s not acceptable to us and not in line with our vision to be the best cloud-based fleet management software provider.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we learned, and how we&#8217;re fixing it going forward.</p>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> is sort of like the <a href="http://wifi-wiz.net/dns/">phonebook of the internet</a>. It&#8217;s how when you type &#8220;fleetio.com&#8221; into your browser, it knows where to go.</p>
<p>We were using a 3rd-party vendor called <a href="http://www.zerigo.com/">Zerigo</a> to manage DNS settings for Fleetio. We were happy with their service until this morning when we couldn&#8217;t reach our servers through the normal channels.</p>
<p>Some quick checking around let us know Zerigo was in the midst of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">Denial of Service Attack</a>, making their service unavailable. Thousands upon thousands of otherwise perfectly fine websites were simultaneously inaccessible as a result, including Fleetio.</p>
<p>We were able to switch DNS service providers to a different 3rd-party vendor fairly quickly, however DNS can sometimes take hours to <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/DNS_propagation">update across the internet</a>. As of around 8:45 AM central U.S. time this morning, things were pretty much back to normal.</p>
<h3>Going forward</h3>
<p>We are going to be using multiple 3rd-party DNS server vendors from now on to guarantee that if one vendor is having an issue, the other one will pick up the slack. We should have done this in the first place, and we have certainly learned a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>We will also be reviewing all parts of our infrastructure to find and resolve any other risks. As a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">software-as-a-service</a> (SaaS) provider of fleet management software, it&#8217;s our mission to ensure Fleetio is available when you need it. You can be certain that we will do whatever it takes to do so.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/blog/new-vehicle-search-navigate-fleetio-with-ease</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><p class="p1">Our mission is to make Fleetio as efficient as possible for our users to manage a fleet. That means it must be both <strong>lightning fast</strong> and <strong>super easy to use</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1">With those goals in mind we just rolled out a new Vehicle Search feature that appears at the top of every screen in the navigation bar. To use it, just start typing the name of a vehicle and you&#8217;ll see some matching results appear.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6wbiljWAz1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p class="p1">Choose a vehicle using the your keyboard&#8217;s arrow keys or by mouse click. You&#8217;ll be taken to that vehicle&#8217;s profile immediately. </p>
<p class="p1">Pretty easy, eh? We think you&#8217;ll really enjoy the powerful simplicity of it.</p>

      <title>New Feature: Save and Add Another</title>
      <link>/blog/new-feature-save-and-add-another</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often times when logging vehicle maintenance or fuel purchases, you end up entering a bunch of records in a row. We just made that process even easier in Fleetio.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6px29MG7v1qkbt2c.png"/><br/><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6px5dAU0a1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a new button on the Service Entry and Fuel Entry forms that will save the current record, then refresh the form allowing you to enter another new record immediately afterwards. This small tweak that makes it much faster to enter several service or fuel entries in a row. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small but useful addition we think you&#8217;ll really like. Log in and check it out, and keep your feedback coming. We&#8217;re listening&#8230;.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Dashboard Facelift - Revamped Reminders</title>
      <link>/blog/dashboard-update-revamped-reminders</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><p class="p1">We&#8217;re excited about the release of the new Fleetio Dashboard screen we&#8217;ve been working on based on your user feedback. The new facelift gives you a better overview of your fleet&#8217;s key performance indicators (KPI) in an easy-to-understand approach.</p>
<h3>Meet the new Reminders Dashboard</h3>
<p class="p1">The Service and Renewal Reminders sections now give you a clear-cut indication of how many reminders are overdue or due soon. If there aren&#8217;t any reminders for a certain category, you get a nice green goose egg letting you things are OK.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6l8w48gDm1qkbt2c.jpg"/></p>
<p class="p1">If there are some overdue or due soon reminders, clicking the number will bring up a dialog window showing you the reminders. Reminders are sorted to show you the &#8220;most overdue&#8221; or &#8220;next coming due&#8221; reminders first, as those are likely the ones needing top attention.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6l8wokVcD1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p class="p1">You can edit a Renewal Reminder or Service Reminder directly from the list. Service Reminders also provide an action to &#8220;Enter Service&#8221; and log that a particular maintenance has been performed just like before.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6l8x39p681qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p class="p1">We added a little warning icon if any vehicles exist in the fleet that don&#8217;t have service and/or renewal reminders setup. Clicking the icon will show you those vehicles.</p>
<p class="p1">The total number of Service &amp; Renewal Reminders is also display as a link. Clicking the link will take you directly to the corresponding report for deeper analysis.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6l8xldVbe1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p class="p1">Our goal is to make managing a fleet easier, and give you the right information to stay on top of fleet maintenance. The Dashboard screen plays a key role in making sure things don&#8217;t slip through the cracks.</p>
<p class="p1">The new Dashboard updates are immediately available, so log in to check it out and let us know what you think. We hope you agree it makes it easier to track your fleet at a glance.</p></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Friday Findings - Jun 15, 2012</title>

<h3>Today&#8217;s finding: <a href="http://capsulecrm.com/">Capsule CRM</a></h3>
<p class="center"><img align="right" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5oa9qtUCM1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://capsulecrm.com/">Capsule CRM</a> is one of the many web-based CRM tools available for SMBs, but it&#8217;s one of the best ones we&#8217;ve found.</p>
<p class="p1">For one, it&#8217;s FAST. This is a huge benefit for a web-based CRM because there is lots of data entry and tons of clicking around when you truly adopt a CRM system. </p>
<p class="p1">Capsule CRM takes the traditional funnel approach to managing a sales pipeline. Nothing to extraordinary, but it&#8217;s simple enough to make sense yet still powerful enough to handle plenty of scenarios.</p>
<p class="p1">Capsule <a href="http://developer.capsulecrm.com/">offers an API</a> and has <a href="http://capsulecrm.com/features#/addons">several integrations out of the box</a> to take advantage of. Many of the smaller CRMs don&#8217;t offer an API, so that&#8217;s a real bonus for Capsule.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://capsulecrm.com/signup">Cost is $12 per user, per month</a>, but there is a free plan so you can try it out for a while and see how it fits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Design Updates - New Dashboard Usage Chart</title>
      <link>/blog/design-updates-new-dashboard-usage-chart</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><p class="center"><img alt="New usage chart in Fleetio fleet maintenance management system" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4ucm06X0j1qkbt2c.jpg"/></p>
<p class="p1">We recently released several great user interface design updates in Fleetio, and we&#8217;ve got several more in the pipeline.  One of the things we enhanced is the usage chart on the Fleetio Dashboard.</p>
<p class="p2">We moved away from just using  basic bar chart and are now using a scatter plot to illustrate both the current meter value <em>as well as the date the vehicle was last updated</em>.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Why is this so great?</strong> Because now you can easily see which meter values might be &#8220;stale&#8221; because they haven&#8217;t been updated in a while.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="Compare mileage, kilometers, engine hours on one chart." src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4ucnoVFpw1qkbt2c.jpg"/></p>
<p class="p1">You can still also quickly tell which vehicles or equipment have been used the most, just like you could on the bar chart.</p>
<p class="p1">We also designed the chart to use different color plot points for miles, kilometers and engine hours. That way mixed fleets can easily distinguish between the different types of equipment.</p>

      <title>Friday Findings - May 11, 2012</title>
      <link>/blog/friday-findings-evernote</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a series of blog posts where we highlight web-based tools we think are interesting and can help your small business.</em></p>
<h3>Today&#8217;s finding: <a href="http://www.evernote.com" title="">Evernote</a></h3>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3twe2qM561qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>Keeping up with stuff in today&#8217;s digital age can be tricky. There are some great file management &amp; syncing tools available today such as <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://www.box.com/">Box</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> that help you organize and share important documents and spreadsheets.</p>
<p>But what about keeping up with simple notes, receipts, important tidbits you find on the web, and all the seemingly small but important things you need to remember later? We humans are pretty bad at remembering things in our short-term memory.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<h3>Remember everything with Evernote.</h3>
<p><a href="http://evernote.com/evernote/">Evernote</a> is one the best productivity tools we&#8217;ve ever found. Whether you use it personally, for business, or a little of both, the benefits are huge.</p>
<p>The Evernote website does a <a href="http://evernote.com/getting_started/">great job of explaining all its capabilities</a>, so here&#8217;s a list of some of the ways we actually use Evernote to make our lives easier:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Setup a default notebook called &#8220;Inbox&#8221;</strong> to serve as your dumping ground for content. You can go back and organize things later.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="http://evernote.com/webclipper/">Evernote Clipper</a> for <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>, or whatever browser you use (why are you not using Chrome?). <strong>Clip website pages, sections of a page, images, etc. with the click of a button.</strong> Learn to use the arrow keys to hone in on what exactly you want to save.<br/><em>Bonus</em>: Evernote automatically saves the URL if you clip a section of a web page, so you can get back to full source if need be down the road.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/scansnap/">Fujitsu ScanSnap</a> to scan documents into Evernote automatically as <strong>searchable PDF files</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Still like handwriting notes from time-to-time?</strong> It&#8217;s ok, we do too. Use something like an index card when jotting down notes, then scan them into Evernote and they become searchable! Wow.</li>
<li>Save your hidden <a href="http://evernote.com/trunk/items/evernote-email?lang=en&amp;layout=default">&#8220;Email to Evernote&#8221;</a> email address in your address book. <strong>Forward emails you want to remember for later.</strong></li>
<li>Did you figure out the Next Big Thing during a brainstorming session but <strong>all the notes are on a whiteboard in the meeting room?</strong> Use the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=281796108&amp;mt=8">iPhone</a> or Android app to snap a pic of the whiteboard and the notes will be on your computer, searchable, before you even get back to your desk.</li>
<li>Write notes. A lot of notes. <strong>Create a notebook called &#8220;Daily&#8221; and just keep a log of the random things you did that might be important later.</strong> Evernote&#8217;s searching ability is pretty incredible and the joy of having something documented that you need a year from now - and being able to find it quickly - well that&#8217;s when productivity feels really, really good.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/region1/eco/diesel/idling.html">According the EPA</a>, a typical heavy-duty truck or bus can burn about <strong>one gallon of diesel fuel for each hour it idles</strong>, generating significant amounts of pollution, wasting fuel, and causing excessive engine wear.</p>
<p>Assuming $4/gallon, reducing idle time by an hour each work day* could <strong>save $1,040 each year per vehicle</strong>. That&#8217;s a number that can add up quickly for even a small fleet.</p>

      <title>Fleetio Updates: Better PM Prioritization and Fuel Entry Time Editing</title>
      <link>/blog/better-pm-prioritization</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve added a several new features to make the Service Schedule Report more useful for prioritizing preventative maintenance (PM) tasks, and we&#8217;ve made managing multiple Fuel Entries for a single day more user friendly.</p>
<h4>New report columns help when prioritizing PM tasks</h4>
<p>The Service Schedule Report is a great place to see an overview of all scheduled PM work across your fleet. But if you have several PM tasks that are overdue or due soon, how do you prioritize those tasks? The new variance columns can help immensely.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3e8nklEDc1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>The &#8220;Meter Variance&#8221; column shows the difference between the scheduled mileage (or kilometers or hours) and the current odometer/hour meter of a vehicle. The &#8220;Time Variance&#8221; column displays the relative time between the current date and the PM task&#8217;s due date.</p>
<p>The variance columns are sortable by clicking the column header, so you can see which ones are the &#8220;most overdue.&#8221; If the current odometer is greater than the scheduled service mileage, then a negative number will be shown. If the service is overdue, the variance number will be in red.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3e8qhVh8J1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>You can also hover any of the variance numbers with your mouse to see the current mileage of the vehicle.</p>
<h4>Adjusting the time on Fuel Entries</h4>
<p>We also added the ability to adjust the time when adding/editing a Fuel Entry in Fleetio. You’ll now see an “Adjust time” link directly below the date input on the Fuel Entry form, which will toggle the time input. </p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3e8txh0Js1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>The time will automatically default to the current time in your selected timezone when adding a new Fuel Entry. The inputs will appear in 24-hour or 12-hour format based on your Account settings.</p>
<p>This is especially helpful when you have multiple fuel-ups in one day and need to make sure the correct order is maintained so fuel efficiency is calculated correctly.</p>
<h4>We ❤ customer suggestions</h4>
<p>Both of these updates came as the result of customer feedback. We&#8217;re always listening to our customers and trying to get a better understanding of their needs, so Fleetio can have a positive impact on the their fleet management operations.</p>

      <title>Revolutionary Regional Support in Fleetio's Fuel Module</title>
      <link>/blog/regional-fuel-management-settings</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Brand spanking new release adds support for UK gallons, liters and different fuel economy options.</h3>
<p>One of the more heavily requested features of late has been to add more regional support to Fleetio&#8217;s Fuel Module. Well, we&#8217;re happy to announce it&#8217;s here!</p>
<h4>Short &amp; sweet overview:</h4>
<ul><li>Choose between US Gallons, UK Gallons or Liters as the volume units. This setting is per vehicle.</li>
<li>Kilometers are now supported in fuel entries.</li>
<li>MPG (US), MPG (UK), L/100km, km/L are all fuel economy options. This setting is per user.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oVRoTpGfis" title="Fleetio's fleet management fuel updates overview video." target="_blank">Watch the overview video on YouTube</a></li>
</ul><h4>Versatile Volume Units: Choose between US gallons, UK gallons or liters.</h4>
<p>When adding a new vehicle or editing an existing one, you can now choose which fuel volume units you want to use when adding fuel entries for the vehicle.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m35nardOCT1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>After setting this option, the Fuel Entry form will show the proper volume input accordingly.</p>
<h4>Expanded distance support now includes kilometers.</h4>
<p>If a vehicle is setup to track usage in kilometers, Fleetio now recognizes the distance between fuel ups in kilometers.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m35nd6Oxes1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<h4>Handy fuel economy options include MPG (US), MPG (UK), L/100km and km/L.</h4>
<p>Each user in Fleetio can choose how they want to view fuel economy values throughout the system. This includes viewing both individual fuel entries and fuel reports across the fleet.</p>
<p>To change you fuel economy units, go to the Edit Profile screen by click your username drop-down on the top navigation bar. You&#8217;ll see it in the Regional Settings section.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m35ng8FFY41qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<h4>A breakthrough in unit conversions.</h4>
<p>One of the more innovative things we did as part of all these new features, was to actually calculate all the different volume values, distance options and fuel economy choices when you add a fuel entry. That way if you have an international fleet with some vehicles using US gallons and some using liters, you can still compare fuel consumption across your fleet.</p>

      <title>New Fuel Report + Other Report Updates and More</title>
      <link>/blog/fuel-report</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently rolled out several changes based on customer feedback that we think you&#8217;ll like.</p>
<h3>Fuel Report</h3>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m20fe4HsGE1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>Now you can easily report on your fuel entries across your fleet. Quickly see how much your spending on fuel for each vehicle, and filter fuel entries by time frame, vehicle information and more.</p>
<p>You can see the total fuel spend for for the given filters at the top of the results screen.</p>
<h3>Other Report Updates</h3>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m20fkmu9cY1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve added the Year/Make/Model &amp; Vehicle Type to several reports, making them even more effective:</p>
<ul><li>Service History Report</li>
<li>Service Schedule Report</li>
<li>Renewal Schedule Report</li>
<li>Fuel Report</li>
</ul><p>We also added the ability to <strong>filter by Service(s) Performed on the Service History Report</strong>. Now you can analyze your fleet maintenance records by certain Service Types!</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m20fpqTBow1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<h3>Edit Custom Year/Make/Models</h3>
<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m20fyiT19b1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also added a new screen in the Account Settings area that lets you edit any custom Year/Make/Model combinations you&#8217;ve added. Fleetio has let you <a href="http://blog.fleetio.com/post/15351293864/new-year-new-features">define custom year/make/model values for a while</a>, and now you can easily adjust those values if need be.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Stay Organized with Custom Renewal Reminders</title>
      <link>/blog/custom-fleet-renewal-reminders</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Fleetio now lets you create your own custom Renewal Reminder types.</h4>
<p>Forgetting important fleet-related deadlines such as inspections or certification renewals can be extremely costly. </p>
<p>Renewal Reminders in Fleetio help people remember important dates for their vehicles, such as annual registrations, emission tests or inspections.</p>
<p>Now you can create your own custom Renewal Reminder Types in Fleetio, making them even more flexible and powerful.</p>
<p>Each Account in Fleetio comes with four standard Renewal Reminder types:</p>
<ul><li>Emission Test</li>
<li>Inspection</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Registration</li>
</ul><p>You can rename or delete any of the standard renewal types, or create your own.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0mh7dCzw81qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>Once you create a custom renewal type for your account, it will show up as an option on each vehicle&#8217;s profile. From there you can set the next due date, and Fleetio will automatically notify you when it&#8217;s coming due (3 weeks before) or overdue.</p>

      <title>Quality Control</title>
      <link>/blog/fleet-quality-control</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="text">
<p><strong>Managing any commercial vehicle fleet requires time and attention to detail, if you want to keep customers, VOSA and company directors happy. Alan Phillips looks at how to save money.</strong></p>
<p><em><small>This is a guest blog post by <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/alan-phillips/19/734/a54" title="Alan Phillips' LinkedIn Profile">Alan Phillips</a> of <a href="http://www.advanceauditing.co.uk/" title="Advance Vehicle Auditing Service Website">Advance Vehicle Auditing Service</a>. Alan has been working in the vehicle industry for over twenty years with a wide range of mechanical experience. Advance Vehicle Auditing Service is based in the UK and helps companies with &#8216;O&#8217; license compliance checks through <a href="http://www.advanceauditing.co.uk/Services.html" title="Advance Vehicle Auditing Services">vehicle inspections, maintenance records auditing, Driver CPC training and more</a>.</small></em></p>
</div>
<p>In these austere times, is cutting back on quality monitoring of your commercial vehicle fleet the way to go? In some instances it just might, but for the vast majority of operators, now, more than ever, it most definitely is not. If quality procedures have been relaxed, how are you going to prove compliance with vehicle maintenance requirements when VOSA comes knocking or you are called before the traffic commissioner? </p>
<p>MoT first-time pass rates may fall, due to relatively minor faults. Roadside checks, too, might take a hit, as a result of small defects, such as poor headlight aim or blown side marker lamps. Or more serious defects may be found, if, for example, sub-standard parts have been fitted or wear allowed to progress beyond service limits. But being able to provide reports detailing areas of concern and actions taken shows at least that attempts are being made to comply with the dictates of O licensing. </p>
<p>Of course, quality monitoring does not have to be carried out by independent third parties. Although this may be a requirement of the traffic commissioner at public inquiries, in-house quality monitoring can be just as effective – sometimes more so. You know your business better than anybody else – mileages covered, type of terrain travelled, loads carried, speeds etc.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, though: are such factors being taken into account when looking at inspection frequencies? Or has a six week period been accepted throughout, because that is what is expected?</p>
<p>If you run with light loads, cover low mileages and travel on normal roads you may be able to extend inspection intervals to eight or even 10 weeks – provided your vehicles remain in a roadworthy condition. But if your vehicles consistently run at maximum payload, cover high mileage and regularly travel over rough terrain, such as construction sites, inspection intervals may have to be reduced to, perhaps, four weeks, so as to ensure that vehicles remain roadworthy.</p>
<p>Quality monitoring by independent third parties, although having a cost implication, does have its upside. Their independence means they have nothing to gain by providing less than honest reports. They may also be able to provide valuable information that cannot, or would not, be shown on in-house reports – such as vehicle inspection reports completed incorrectly, vehicles repaired to incorrect standards, etc.</p>
<p>Time can also be freed up for transport managers, allowing them more space to carry out their day-to-day duties. For example, nobody likes driver checks so third parties are an excellent way to delegate this responsibility. By using a person who is independent of your organisation, and unknown to the drivers, watching them carry out daily vehicle checks and monitoring their tachograph charts for irregularities, in-house confrontations can be avoided.</p>
<p>Remedial action will still be required to areas of concern found. That may involve further training for staff, more frequent driver spot checks or simply putting vehicle maintenance files into chronological order. Yes, there is a cost to all of this, but by carefully shopping around, real value for money can be found. And the plain fact is that having robust maintenance systems and practices in place, as well as good MoT pass rates, clear roadside checks and drivers complying with driving hours, breaks etc saves money and reputations.</p>
<p>Further, by keeping vehicles well maintained they remain reliable, can be on the road for longer (within driving limits) and may cost less in parts-replacement. Drivers will also be happier, driving vehicles they know are dependable – meaning they are less likely to complain and/or produce unnecessary defect reports.</p>
<p>With the authorities clamping down on poor operators, being able to show that your maintenance systems and driver procedures are compliant is a smart move.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tracking Vehicle Status in Fleetio</title>
      <link>/blog/tracking-vehicle-status</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="center"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz19cdcHsX1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>We recently added a new feature in Fleetio to help you keep your vehicles &amp; equipment better organized by assigning a &#8220;status&#8221; to each. Fleet managers can now easily get a birds eye view of the fleet and quickly see which vehicles are available.</p>
<p>Say you&#8217;ve got a vehicle in the shop for maintenance. You can set the status of that vehicle to &#8220;In Shop&#8221; so you and others will know where it is and why it&#8217;s not available.</p>
<p>Same thing could apply to a piece of equipment that&#8217;s out of service.</p>
<p>All accounts are automatically be seeded with the following status options:</p>
<ul><li>Active</li>
<li>Inactive</li>
<li>In Shop</li>
<li>Out of Service</li>
<li>Sold</li>
</ul><p>But of course, we try to make Fleetio as flexible as possible so it serves a wide range of needs - so <strong>status options are completely customizable per account</strong>. Change the existing ones, or add your own that make sense for your organization!</p>

      <title>Well-trained drivers have the best effect on PM activities</title>
      <link>/blog/drivers-affect-fleet-maintenance</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><p class="p1">A recent <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;gid=2786781&amp;trk=anet_ug_hm&amp;goback=%2Egde_2786781_member_88995420%2Egmp_2786781" title="Fleet Maintenance Professionals group on LinkedIn" target="_blank">Fleet Maintenance Professionals</a> discussion on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com" title="LinkedIn" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> asked: Which PM activities account for most of your cost savings and efficiency improvements? Which preventative maintenance actions derive the most benefit and should be at the top of fleet&#8217;s list?</p>
<p class="p1">Turns out, a big influence on preventative maintenance effectiveness is driver training. Drivers who understand the importance of vehicle maintenance and care often have the best fleet performance and lowest costs.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/alan-phillips/19/734/a54" title="Alan Philips on LinkedIn">Alan Philips</a></span><span class="s2"> of <a href="http://www.advanceauditing.co.uk/" title="Advance Vehicle Auditing Service"><span class="s1">Advance Vehicle Auditing Service</span></a> writes:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The driver is not just the person that delivers the consignment, but is the first, and I feel, the most important part of the maintenance system. By carrying out daily vehicle checks, the driver can report defects at an early stage allowing defect rectification to be assessed and planned to reduce vehicle downtime, therefore reducing vehicle spend, ensuring vehicle safety, and improving business efficiencies.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">How do you get your drivers to care? <strong>You have to create a culture where preventative maintenance is important.</strong> Drivers must feel comfortable bringing up issues they&#8217;ve noticed, and confident that the company will actually fix vehicle problems. </p>
<p class="p1">Having a systematic process for drivers to submit issues and follow up on the status is key. Fleets that provide a maintenance feedback loop reap huge benefits down the road - in cost reduction, efficiency improvements and employee satisfaction.</p>
<h4>Start today</h4>
<p class="p1">Here are some ideas for getting a basic vehicle maintenance feedback loop in place:</p>
<ul class="ul1"><li class="li1">Send an email to all drivers simply asking them how their vehicles are doing.</li>
<li class="li1">Review fleet maintenance costs to find the drivers responsible for the best &amp; worst performing vehicles. Try to understand the difference between them to identify some action items specific to your fleet.</li>
<li class="li1">If your fleet is not already required to perform daily inspections, develop a simple inspection process and get your drivers on board with it. Create a sheet with the basic inspection tasks and ask them to fill it out at least once a week. This is also a great way to get consistent odometer readings.</li>
</ul></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1">As of January 3rd this year, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (<a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/"><span class="s1">FMCSA</span></a>) banned the use of mobile phones while operating a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) unless using a completely hands-free system to talk. Commercial drivers aren&#8217;t allowed to text message or even dial a phone number while driving under the new regulation.</p>
<p class="p1">And violating the new law has monstrous repercussions: up to $2,750 for each offense for drivers and companies whose drivers violate the law could be on the hook for $11,000.</p>
<p class="p1">With the hefty fines, many fleets will proactively find ways to make sure their drivers don&#8217;t even have the option to violate the law - and the cellCONTROL from Schosche could be right ingredient. You can buy the device for $129.95 or the devices are also available for $24.95 with an additional $7.95 per month subscription fee.</p>
<p class="p1">Could be well worth added safety insurance and avoidance of substantial fines.</p>

      <title>Fleetio Updates - Jan 18, 2012</title>
      <link>/blog/fleet-software-updates-jan-18-2012</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>New vehicle profile design, locations, photos &amp; more.</h3>
<p>We appreciate the ongoing feedback we receive from our users, and we&#8217;re happy to announce the roll out of several highly-requested features. Say hello to locations, photos, and the all-new vehicle profile design.</p>
<h4>New Vehicle Profile Design</h4>
<p><img alt="New Fleetio profile design makes Fleetio the easiest fleet management software system available" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly06wtfBt41qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>We revamped the vehicle profile experience, making it easier to get a quick overview of a vehicle and navigate its details in an organized way.</p>
<p><img alt="Quick overview of a vehicle makes maintenance management easy for fleet managers" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly0704oXDv1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>Quickly review important information about a vehicle, such as usage, preventative maintenance status, and assigned location (more on that below), as well as summarized costs for each vehicle.</p>
<p>Common actions like updating the odometer, entering maintenance or fuel are even easier using the new action buttons.</p>
<p><img alt="Vehicle management information overview" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly072nhp5S1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>The Overview section organizes information across several tabs, starting with a &#8220;General&#8221; section which displays the basic details about a vehicle. Other tabs include Photos, Renewal Dates, and Purchase information.</p>
<h5>Vehicle Purchase and Warranty Information</h5>
<p><img alt="Store vehicle purchase and warranty information in Fleetio fleet management software" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly07dxzfRy1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>In addition to purchase date, price &amp; original meter value, you can now save comments about each vehicle purchase. You can also keep track of manufacturer&#8217;s warranty information as well - both the expiration date and max miles/kilometers/hours.</p>
<h4>Vehicle Photos</h4>
<p><img alt="Store vehicle photos in Fleetio fleet management software" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly07gqWbmP1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>Upload multiple photos for each vehicle, and choose one to be the profile pic. Add photos of needed repairs, accident damage or just photos of your vehicle in the sunset ;)</p>
<p><img alt="Store vehicle photos in Fleetio fleet management software" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly07k5dQUx1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<h4>Location, Location, Location</h4>
<p><img alt="Assign vehicles to a location in Fleetio fleet management software" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly07ob2TQa1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>Add your own custom locations and assign vehicles to them. This will help you better organize your vehicles, especially for multi-location fleets.</p>
<p><img alt="Store vehicle locations in Fleetio fleet management software" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly07qkuawG1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>Add as many locations as you need, and assign a vehicle to a location when on the add/edit vehicle form.</p>
<h4>New Vehicle List Options</h4>
<p><img alt="Vehicle sorting options in Fleetio fleet management software" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly07tpY6W41qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>We added sorting options to the vehicle list screen (get to it from the Vehicles -&gt; All Vehicles link in the navigation bar at the top). List your vehicles by:</p>
<ul><li>Name</li>
<li>Type</li>
<li>Location</li>
</ul><p>As an added bonus, when you choose a different sorting option, Fleetio will remember your choice the next time you come back to the vehicle list screen. Handy!</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy these new features. <a href="https://secure.fleetio.com/login" title="Fleet maintenance software login">Log in now to see for yourself</a>. As always, we look forward to hearing from you if you have any questions, feature suggestions or feedback. Thanks for using Fleetio!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Don't skimp on vehicle maintenance to save cash</title>
      <link>/blog/dont-skip-vehicle-maintenance-to-save-cash</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><p class="p1">It&#8217;s important for a business to hold on to cash during tough economic times. Consequently many companies don&#8217;t replace their vehicles as often and need to keep an aging fleet running in order to conserve financial resources.</p>
<p class="p1">You must resist the urge to cut maintenance spending as well. It rarely saves much money, even in the short term, but the long effects can be detrimental to your cash down the road. When you keep fleet equipment longer with less maintenance, both reliability and safety will suffer. </p>
<p class="p1">And remember, you might be married to your vehicles for quite a bit longer than expected.</p></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New Year, New Features</title>
      <link>/blog/new-year-new-features</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re kicking off 2012 with a bang by releasing a ton of Fleetio updates and new features out the wazoo. <a href="https://secure.fleetio.com/register" title="Register for Fleetio fleet maintenance software">Register</a> or <a href="https://secure.fleetio.com/login" title="Log in to Fleetio fleet maintenance software">log in</a> to check out the awesomeness.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick rundown of the major updates:</p>
<ul><li>Custom make/model/year values</li>
<li>Assign a &#8220;type&#8221; to better organize your vehicles/equipment</li>
<li>Track vehicles by miles, kilometers, or engine hours</li>
<li>&#8220;Due Soon&#8221; threshold customization</li>
</ul><h3>Custom Year/Make/Models</h3>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxc636P2nZ1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>There&#8217;s already a wealth of car, light and heavy duty truck options when adding a new vehicle in Fleetio (~ 30,000!), but now you can enter your own custom values too.</p>
<p>This makes it possible to use Fleetio for &#8220;vehicle-like&#8221; equipment for which you want to manage information &amp; track maintenance. Tractors, boats, ATVs, generators&#8230;.the possibilities are endless!</p>
<h3>Organize Vehicles by Type</h3>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxc6cefpeV1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>You can now assign a &#8220;type&#8221; to each vehicle which basically acts as a label and makes it easier to identify a particular piece of equipment. The &#8220;type&#8221; options are completely customizable and we even added a few to get you going.</p>
<p>We plan to make use of the vehicle &#8220;type&#8221; more and more in the near future, especially around reporting.</p>
<h3>Track Usage by Miles, Kilometers, or Engine Hours</h3>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxc67hMznu1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>Now you can choose how you want to track the utilization of each vehicle.</p>
<p>Distance-based options include miles &amp; kilometers, so now Fleetio can be used by those on the metric system. Hello internationalization!</p>
<p>You can also choose to track usage by engine hours. This makes it easier to track things like tractors, boats, golf carts, ATVs, generators, etc. when it doesn&#8217;t really make sense to track distance.</p>
<h3>Custom &#8220;Due Soon&#8221; Thresholds</h3>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxc6fkJGCx1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>What does &#8220;due soon&#8221; mean to you for a particular service reminder? Now you can customize what it means for each service reminder in Fleetio.</p>
<p>Say you want to be notified when &#8220;Vehicle A&#8221; is due for an oil change 250 miles beforehand, but you want to be notified when &#8220;Vehicle B&#8221; is due for a tire rotation only 50 miles ahead of time. Now it&#8217;s totally possible in Fleetio!</p>
<p><strong>2012 will be a big year for Fleetio</strong>, and this is only the beginning. <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/pricing" title="Fleet maintenance software pricing - Fleetio">Get on board today</a> and start using Fleetio to manage your fleet, and track vehicle maintenance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Happy Holidays from the Fleetio Team</title>
      <link>/blog/happy-holidays</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t believe the holidays are actually here. We want to wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season and let our customers know how much we appreciate them.</p>
<p>As 2011 draws to a close, it&#8217;s nice to look back and recognize what great year it has been.</p>
<p>Back in the spring, we saw a need for better web-based fleet maintenance management software, so we started talking to lots of businesses and working on some ideas. Over the summer we built the initial version with the help of our beta customers and launched in the fall. It&#8217;s been a lot of hard work, but we absolutely love it.</p>
<p>All the while, time has flown by.</p>
<p>2011 was only the beginning for Fleetio. 2012 will be even better.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be starting the year off with a big release that makes it even easier to track more of your assets &amp; equipment in Fleetio. We&#8217;re also adding ways to log and track more details about all that equipment while still keeping Fleetio simple and easy to use.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be continuing to add more services and refine our existing services that make it easier to run a busy business with a fleet, such as our <a href="http://www.fleetio.com/assistant-fleet-manager" title="Our Assistant Fleet Manager Service handles all your fleet maintenance document scanning and data entry for you">Assistant Fleet Manager Service</a>. We&#8217;re even working on new and innovative ways to make tracking the health of your vehicles more automated and seamless. It&#8217;s going to be revolutionary.</p>
<p>We appreciate all our wonderful customers, and the great feedback they&#8217;ve given us along the way. We look forward to our continued partnership and all the great things 2012 will bring.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays to you and yours.</p>
<p>Tony Summerville<br/><em>Founder &amp; CEO</em> </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>The Cost of Vehicle Downtime</h2>
<p>When a vehicle breaks down, the cost of downtime is far more than the cost of the inevitable repairs. To truly understand how unplanned vehicle downtime affects your bottom line, consider the following:</p>
<ul><li>Revenue loss from a canceled order or appointment</li>
<li>Salary of the now idle driver who can&#8217;t do his or her job</li>
<li>Cost to rent a replacement vehicle during the downtime</li>
<li>Customer irritation due to missed appointments</li>
<li>Lost opportunity cost from irritated customers posting on Twitter about your business</li>
<li>Potential customers seeing your branded vehicle broken down on the side of the road</li>
<li>Missed incentives for being early or on-time</li>
<li>Late penalties</li>
<li>Extra manpower to move cargo to another vehicle</li>
<li>Replacement cost of ruined goods</li>
</ul><p>Unplanned vehicle downtime is far too costly to ignore, yet fairly easy to keep in check. A good preventative maintenance program and <a href="http://www.fleetio.com" title="Fleetio Fleet Maintenance Software">fleet maintenance system</a> can substantially reduce your risk.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Fleetio Update - Nov. 21, 2011</title>
      <link>/blog/better-maintenance-reminders</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>More Preventative Maintenance Scheduling Options</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve gotten lots of feedback about the way Service Reminders should work, particularly when setting up reminder intervals. Some customers wanted to create maintenance schedules based on mileage (usage) alone, while others wanted to set simple time-based reminders for some services and inspections.</p>
<p>Service Reminders can now be setup three different ways:</p>
<ol><li>Usage-based only (Oil Change every 6,000 miles)</li>
<li>Time-based only (Car Wash every month)</li>
<li>Combination of both, whichever comes first (this is they way Service Reminders previously worked)</li>
</ol><p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lv108d4ZOC1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>We were able to keep the user interface very simple and straightforward. If you don&#8217;t want to use a particular interval type, just leave it blank.</p>
<p>The reminder schedule preview still works the same way, and takes into account the interval settings you&#8217;ve chosen.</p>
<p>Other places throughout Fleetio have been updated so your preventative maintenance and service schedule makes sense based on a reminder&#8217;s setup:</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve refreshed the design of Fleetio, making it even easier to manage your fleet. The latest improvements include:</p>

<li>Clearer buttons throughout Fleetio make actions on each screen more noticeable.</li>
<li>Longer lists of data are now broken up into multiple &#8220;pages&#8221; increasing the speed of each page load.</li>

      <title>Friday Findings - Oct 21, 2011</title>
      <link>/blog/friday-findings-xero-instapaper-insightly</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a new series of blog posts where we highlight web-based tools we think are interesting and can help your small business.</p>
<h3>Today&#8217;s topics: <a href="http://www.xero.com/">Xero</a>, <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> &amp; <a href="http://insight.ly/">Insightly</a></h3>
<h3><a href="http://www.xero.com/">Xero</a></h3>
<p>Xero is a web-based accounting system that we&#8217;ve really enjoyed using to handle the books at RareStep. Why we like it:</p>
<ul><li>Beautiful, user friendly software that almost makes accounting fun. Almost. We found it much more enjoyable to use than Quickbooks Online. </li>
<li>It saves a bunch of time. Setting up things like automatic bank feeds and recurring invoices sped up boring bookkeeping tasks so we could focus on more important things.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s web-based so you can log in to check the health of your business from anywhere. They even have a great <a href="http://www.xero.com/mac-accounting/">iPhone app</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://help.xero.com/">Xero Help Center</a> is really, really good.</li>
<li>Very affordable at $20 - $40 per month.</li>
</ul><h3><a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a></h3>
<p>Instapaper is a &#8220;simple tool to save web pages for reading later.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s so much great content to read on the web, but it can be hard to keep up without sitting in front of a computer all day. Instapaper lets you save web pages and articles to read later on your <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/iphone">iPhone or iPad</a>. It strips out everything other than the main content so you can read it like a book or magazine article.</p>
<p>We use it to save articles we come across and read them later when we have the time (such as waiting in line somewhere or at the doctor&#8217;s office).</p>
<h3><a href="http://insight.ly/">Insightly</a></h3>
<p>Insightly is a refreshing simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">CRM system</a> that&#8217;s tightly integrated with <a href="http://www.google.com/a">Google Apps</a>. We love it because:</p>
<ul><li>Seriously simple, yet very effective. There are a lot of <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/crm/">bloated</a> <a href="http://crm.dynamics.com">CRM</a> <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com">systems</a> today but your business may not need all the extras. It&#8217;s nice to use a system that just does the basics really well.</li>
<li>Tight integration with Google Apps makes it easy to manage users, share documents and attach emails to CRM records.</li>
<li>Awesome relationship support. Insightly lets you easily track more than just employee/employer relationships. Keeping up with who knows whom and how you met different people is important for building solid connections that will help your business grow.</li>
<li><a href="http://insight.ly/pricing">Free for up to three users</a>, then jumps to $29/month.</li>
</ul><ul></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Always Be Marketing with Clean Fleet Vehicles</h2>
<p>Potential customers may only come across your company when they see your vehicles out on the road. Of course they&#8217;ll take notice when a bad driver is all over the place, not obeying the rules of road.</p>
<p>But people also draw assumptions about your company based on the condition of fleet vehicles. One easy and inexpensive way to enhance those assumptions is to keep your fleet vehicles clean.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s particularly important for service companies. If your vehicles are a mess, what does that say about the work you do? You might think there&#8217;s no correlation but that doesn&#8217;t keep the potential customer from thinking it.</p>
<p>Many local car washes will set you up with a business account and bill you for washes each month, giving you a volume discount as well. Then your drivers can get their vehicles cleaned without having to deal with payments. Nice and simple.</p>
<p>Keeping track of drivers cleaning their vehicles is something <a title="Fleetio homepage" href="http://www.fleetio.com">Fleetio</a> can help you with. Simply setup a recurring service reminder for how often you want each vehicle to be washed, and Fleetio will keep track of who&#8217;s visiting the car wash…and who isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Much like the <a title='"Always Be Closing" speech on YouTube' target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQPY4LlbJ4">famous speech from Glengarry Glen Ross</a>, companies should <strong>Always Be Marketing</strong>. You never know who&#8217;s paying attention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>AutoMate is now Fleetio</title>
      <link>/blog/automate-is-fleetio</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were never 100% satisfied with AutoMate as our product name, so we decided to make a change before we launch publicly. We think Fleetio is easier to remember and is more in tune with our vision &amp; approach to vehicle/fleet management.</p>
<p class="center"><a href="http://www.fleetio.com"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lry87qisXK1qkbt2c.png"/></a></p>
<h3>Why change?</h3>
<ul><li>We found ourselves always saying &#8220;it&#8217;s AutoMate&#8230;with a capital A &amp; M&#8221; when we described our product. It just felt clumsy.</li>
<li>&#8220;automate&#8221; is such a common word, users had a hard time finding it through a search engine if they couldn&#8217;t remember the URL.</li>
<li>automateapp.com is an OK domain name, but it has the extraneous &#8220;app&#8221; pasted to the end. Now we have a more pure domain name, <a href="http://www.fleetio.com">fleetio.com</a>, and even snagged <a href="http://fleet.io">fleet.io</a> too.</li>
<li>Fleetio is just down right more fun to say. Try it for yourself. We hope you&#8217;ll like it as much as we do.</li>

      <link>/blog/manage-custom-service-types</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve released an update to let you easily manage all of your custom service types for your account in AutoMate.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrmwecAxrU1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p>Now you can add new service types and edit or delete existing ones all in one place. You can also see how many service entries and service reminders are using a particular service type. Handy.</p>
<p>Check it out by clicking <em>Account → Service Types</em> after logging in.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Add your own Service Types</h2>
<p>AutoMate now lets you add custom service types for service entries, making it even more flexible to handle your fleet maintenance/service tracking needs.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve made it ridiculously easy to add a custom service type when creating a new service entry or editing an existing one. And once you add a custom service type, you&#8217;ll be able to use for all vehicles in your account. Booyah!</p>

<h3>Bonus alert!</h3>
<p>What&#8217;s cooler than adding your own custom service types for service entries? Being able to use them for service reminders!</p>
<p>Yep, you can even create service reminders using your custom service types for any vehicle in your fleet. Pretty sweet, eh?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Fuel Management Arrives</h2>
<h4>AutoMate now makes it easy to log your fleet&#8217;s fuel usage and get a better handle on fuel costs.</h4>
<p>With the latest release of AutoMate, you can now log fuel usage for your vehicles. Our goal is to provide better visibility into fuel consumption, making it easier to manage costs and gain insight into vehicle &amp; driver efficiency.</p>
<h3>Creating a Fuel Entry</h3>
<p>Simple &amp; straight-forward. Just provide the fuel-up date, volume (in gallons or litres) and the odometer reading. You can optionally provide the price/gallon to keep track of fuel costs.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq4r1pUf6u1qkbt2c.jpg"/></p>
<h3>Viewing Fuel Usage</h3>
<p>You can view all fuel entries for any vehicle, along with a chart showing the miles-per-gallon (MPG) breakdown for the past 6 months.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq4r9nVaXw1qkbt2c.jpg"/></p>
<p>More fuel-related reports are coming soon, as well as the ability to log fuel usage based on trip mileage (or km) instead of odometer readings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Multiple Users Per Account</h2>
<h4>New in AutoMate: Add users to your account to make vehicle maintenance more collaborative</h4>
<p>One our our biggest goals with AutoMate is to make it easy for stakeholders at a businesses to collaborate on fleet maintenance, and share information with one another. With the new AutoMate release, we&#8217;re one step closer to that goal.</p>
<p>You can now invite anyone with an email address to join your AutoMate account. This means key stakeholders such as the fleet manager, financial team, individual drivers and executives can all access the same information from wherever they are, and remain up-to-date on the status of the fleet.</p>
<h3>User Roles</h3>
<p>For now, we&#8217;ve tried to keep it simple and only introduced two roles in the multi-user functionality:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Manager:</strong> These are people who can enter data, administer automobiles, add/remove users, or change account settings (except for billing information).</li>
<li><strong>Notifications Only:</strong> These people can only receive emails for service reminders. They cannot actually log in to the account and enter any data.</li>
</ul><p>We&#8217;re pretty excited about the release of this new feature as it lays the foundation for people within companies to work together to manage and track their fleet&#8217;s maintenance schedule.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll continue to make it better and better based on your feedback.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Notes &amp; Documents Sittin&#8217; in a Cloud</h2>
<h4>New in AutoMate: Store documents &amp; add notes to any vehicle</h4>
<p>Happy Friday! We&#8217;ve just rolled out some new features to <a href="http://www.automateapp.com">AutoMate</a> that make it an even better repository for all things related to your fleet.</p>
<h3>Upload Documents</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/automate-blog/20110715/AutoMate+-+Documents.png"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loe2r1rHAc1qkbt2c.png"/></a></p>
<p>You can now easily &amp; securely store documents for a particular automobile in AutoMate. Things like the bill of sale, insurance records, and other files can be uploaded &#8220;to the cloud&#8221; so they&#8217;re quickly available wherever you are.</p>
<h3>Vehicle Notes</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/automate-blog/20110715/AutoMate+-+Notes.png"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loe36cxSEi1qkbt2c.png"/></a></p>
<p>Use the new notes feature to record extra information and comments about a vehicle. This is useful for all the random things you want to remember about an automobile, but don&#8217;t have a good place to store. Track things like driver changes, small repairs and add-ons, or anything else that you want to keep up with.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Want Early Access?</h2>
<p>We recently launched AutoMate &#8220;in beta&#8221; which is just a fancy way of saying we&#8217;ve started giving early access to businesses who want to try it out (free of charge, of course), and are willing to provide helpful feedback &amp; test new features as they are released.</p>
<p>Great software is never developed in a vacuum. It thrives on real input from real users. The beta process is like reading an early draft of a new novel, or seeing an advance screening of a new movie. The author or director has a vision in mind, but needs input from real people to turn a good book or movie into a great one.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already gotten some great feedback from our beta customers based on their real-world usage. If you would like early access for your business, <a href="http://www.automateapp.com/apply">let us know by filling out this short application</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Introducing AutoMate</title>
      <link>/blog/introducing-automate</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loa9lhUnDS1qkbt2c.png"/></p>
<p><a title="AutoMate Home" target="_blank" href="http://www.automateapp.com/">AutoMate</a> is a new vehicle &amp; fleet management solution that lets you keep your complete vehicle maintenance history in one place and be reminded when it&#8217;s the right time for the right service.</p>
<p>As part of this introduction, I&#8217;d like to give you some background on why I set out to build AutoMate, and what the fundamental goals are for the software.</p>
<h3>Why Fleet Management?</h3>
<p>I first became interested in vehicle management more from a personal standpoint. I always had trouble remembering what maintenance had been done to my truck &amp; when it occurred. The oil change sticker on the windshield was my only maintenance reminder.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also responsible for keeping track of the maintenance on my wife&#8217;s car, but I don&#8217;t drive it often and rarely think about it truth be told.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I knew this was not a good way to handle our expensive investments that we rely on every day - especially my truck that&#8217;s getting up there in mileage and needs more frequent attention.</p>
<p>So I started researching vehicle maintenance log solutions and didn&#8217;t find much other than an few simplistic iPhone apps, and some antiquated &#8220;installed&#8221; software applications that looked painful to use.</p>
<p>I also started to think about all the businesses that use vehicles as an important part of their operations, and figured if two vehicles are hard to manage, how are these businesses keeping track of 10, 50, 100+ vehicles? As I researched more and more, I found that many of the existing fleet management solutions were more focused on vehicle GPS tracking and somewhat lacking when it came to managing fleet maintenance history &amp; schedules in a powerful, yet simple &amp; elegant way.</p>
<p>So I started talking to different businesses that have vehicles to ask them how they manage their fleet.</p>
<p>I found that many businesses don&#8217;t keep track of their vehicles&#8217; maintenance - and they knew that was a bad thing - but they hadn&#8217;t found a good way to do it.</p>
<p>Or some businesses use a tool like Excel to track their fleet maintenance, which is better than nothing. But it&#8217;s difficult to collaborate on an Excel document, and it can&#8217;t automatically remind you when it&#8217;s time for a particular maintenance - you have to manually open the file &amp; look at it.</p>
<p>So I set out to build a better solution with some key principles in mind&#8230;</p>
<h3>Fundamental Goals</h3>
<ul><li><strong>It must be easy to use.</strong> Many people at smaller companies take over the responsibility of managing the fleet, but it&#8217;s not their primary job. They have a million other things to do so their time spent managing the fleet should be quick &amp; effective. You shouldn&#8217;t need a mechanic background to understand the software.</li>
<li><strong>It must be collaborative.</strong> Sure it may be one person&#8217;s responsibility to oversee the fleet, but there are a lot of other stakeholders when a business relies on their vehicles each day. The more everyone can stay informed and share the responsibility of managing the fleet, the longer the investment will last.</li>
<li><strong>It should go to where the users are.</strong> People are in their email all day — both at their desk and on their phones. A good fleet management system should go to where its users are to proactively remind them of maintenance &amp; other things. It shouldn&#8217;t expect them to have to log in all the time to manage the fleet.</li>
<li><strong>It should be a repository for everything related to fleet maintenance.</strong> Invoices, receipts &amp; other documents, as well as random notes should all be in one place, accessible everywhere. Finding the invoice for the timing belt replacement from 2 years ago shouldn&#8217;t take an hour rummaging through a file cabinet.</li>
<li><strong>It should help companies make better vehicle investments.</strong> At the end of the day, AutoMate must truly help boost the life of vehicles, and help companies make better decisions to get more value out of their vehicle investments.</li>
</ul><h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>
<p>So far, progress is coming along great but we&#8217;ve still got some work to do. We&#8217;ve launched some &#8220;early adopter&#8221; customers on AutoMate and are currently testing &amp; refining the software with them before opening it up to the general public.</p>
<p>We want and need to hear more feedback - what&#8217;s good, what&#8217;s not so good, and what’s missing. <a href="mailto:info@automateapp.com">Contact us</a> if you would like early access (for free!), and are willing to provide helpful feedback &amp; test new features as they are released.</p>
